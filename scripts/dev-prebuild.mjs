/**
 * Serialized dev prestep: ensure dependencies are installed, then build what the dev
 * servers consume: packages/core, and packages/cli for the `penguin` a dev server hands the
 * Agents it runs (it writes a shim at `<root>/bin/penguin` pointing at
 * `packages/cli/dist/penguin.js`, so that file has to exist and be current when the server
 * starts — `tsx watch` never rebuilds it).
 *
 * dev:server and dev:web must build packages/core before starting
 * (never start on stale deps — see the 2026-07-17 design changelog entry), and every dev
 * command needs `pnpm install` to be current (a fresh clone, or a pulled lockfile change,
 * otherwise starts against missing/stale packages). But when two dev commands launch at the
 * same time in separate terminals, concurrent installs/builds would race (tsup runs with
 * clean:true, so one build deletes files the other just wrote). This script makes the
 * prestep safe and cheap to invoke concurrently:
 *
 * - An exclusive on-disk lock serializes invocations; a second invocation waits instead of
 *   clobbering. The lock (and the stamps below) live under the OS temp directory keyed by
 *   the repo path, so they exist even before node_modules does (a fresh clone can run any
 *   dev command directly). Locks left behind by crashed runs are stolen when the holder PID
 *   is dead or the lock is impossibly old.
 * - Install freshness is stamped with the pnpm-lock.yaml content hash: `pnpm install` runs
 *   only when node_modules is missing or the lockfile changed since the last stamped
 *   install, so the usual dev start pays nothing.
 * - A build success stamp collapses duplicate builds: an invocation that acquires the lock
 *   right after another one finished (within SKIP_WINDOW_MS) skips the rebuild, so a
 *   simultaneous dev:server + dev:web start builds once, and dev:server's inner
 *   re-invocation (from packages/server's dev script) is a no-op. The window is
 *   deliberately tiny so a human edit-then-restart cycle always rebuilds.
 *
 * Usage: `node scripts/dev-prebuild.mjs` (install + build core/cli) or
 * `node scripts/dev-prebuild.mjs --install-only` (dev:docs / dev:landing — no workspace
 * deps to build, but installs must still be current).
