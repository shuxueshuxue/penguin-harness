/**
 * Server process entry point: the whole startup lifecycle, as one ordered sequence.
 *
 * Importing this module STARTS the server — the CLI runs a server in its own process by
 * `await import("@prismshadow/penguin-server")` and nothing else, so main() is invoked at
 * module scope rather than exported.
 *
 * main() comes first in the file and is the sequence itself: each step is one PenguinServer
 * method, named after what it does and appearing in the order main() calls it. The order
 * carries real constraints — the proxy dispatcher before any outbound request, the instance
 * lock before the database opens, plugins loaded before the platform boots against them,
 * the platform (and with it the whole business surface) before the first request is
 * served — so each step documents the constraint it stands on.
 *
 * Tests never go through this file (they inject via app.request() instead).
