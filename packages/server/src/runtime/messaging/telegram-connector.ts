/**
 * Telegram messaging connector — the second implementation of the
 * MessagingChannelConnector seam, and the proof the seam is channel-neutral. It owns
 * everything Telegram-specific: the config document's shape (a single bot token), the
 * Bot API transport behind it (injectable for tests — see telegram-api.ts), the forum-topic
 * routing it packs into the bridge's opaque chat and reply refs (see chatRefOf), and the
 * inbound side as a `getUpdates` long-poll loop — Telegram pushes nothing without a
 * public webhook URL, so the connector pulls, which keeps local deployments working
 * exactly like the Feishu long connection does.
 *
 * The poll loop's lifecycle: a `getMe` probe (a bad token surfaces immediately as the
 * connection error instead of an eternally failing poll — it runs again ahead of every
 * recovery attempt, so a token revoked mid-outage stops reading as a stale conflict, and
 * its answer is what lets a group message's opening mention of THIS bot be stripped — see
 * stripBotMention), a
 * `getWebhookInfo` probe (a webhook and `getUpdates` are mutually exclusive on the Bot API,
 * so a bot pointed at one cannot be polled until the webhook goes — the probe names it and
 * stops there, because removing it is the user's call: see below), then a one-time backlog
 * drain (`offset: -1` confirms everything sent while no connection existed
 * — a disabled binding must not replay its dark period as a task flood, matching Feishu,
 * where missed events are simply gone), then long polls advancing `offset` past each update.
 * Failures back off exponentially and report once per outage; recovery fires `onReady`
 * again, so the bridge's status tracks the outage.
 *
 * Readiness is proven by a `getUpdates`, NEVER by `getMe`. Telegram's one-poller-per-token
 * rule shows up only on `getUpdates`, as a 409 — a second server (or any other program)
 * holding the same token. `getMe` answers happily throughout, so a
 * recovery gated on `getMe` alone would clear the outage counter on every cycle: the
 * backoff would never leave its first step and every single failure would report again.
 * The recovery poll therefore runs with `timeoutSec: 0` — it must come back now, not park
 * for the long-poll window — and only its success clears `failures` and fires `onReady`.
 *
 * Nothing here writes to the bot. A registered webhook is reported, never deleted: it points
 * at whatever service the user set it on, and clearing it to make polling work here would
 * take that service off the air with no notice and no way to trace it back. So the probe
 * repeats on every recovery attempt rather than latching — the outage ends the moment the
 * user removes the webhook, and the connection then comes back on its own.
