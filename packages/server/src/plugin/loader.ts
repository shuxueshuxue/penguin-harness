/**
 * Plugin loading: WHICH plugins a deployment runs is CONFIGURATION, not capability
 * baked into the platform.
 *
 * The configuration is per PROJECT (`plugins` in `.project_config.toml`), because machines
 * are lent to Projects and that is what says which machines a plugin has to reach. Loading
 * is per PROCESS, though — there is one module tree — so what a deployment runs is the
 * CLOSURE: the union over its Projects. A plugin any Project asks for is in the tree, and
 * what it contributes is visible to all of them.
 *
 * The closure is read from the FILES, without the database: this runs at boot, before the
 * platform exists, and a Project is a directory holding a `.project_config.toml`.
 *
 * Resolution is anchored at `process.argv[1]`, for the same reason the packaged
 * bundle's own resolver is: a bundle running from `hmr/store` has no node_modules of
 * its own, so anchoring at the bundle would find nothing.
 *
 * Failure is per-entry and non-fatal: an unresolvable or malformed plugin is reported
 * and skipped, leaving its capability unavailable rather than failing the boot. An
 * plugin is a set of modules (core plugin/index.ts): `package.json#penguin.modules`
 * carries the manifests, the default export the code, paired by name.
