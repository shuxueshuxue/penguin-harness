/**
 * Plugin registries: WHERE plugin index entries come from. A registry is one source
 * of `PluginIndexEntry` rows — the shared index format every registry speaks (see
 * api/types.ts; the schema follows typst/packages' `index.json`: a flat array of
 * per-version entries). Discovery only: a Project asks for an entry on the Plugins page
 * (http/routes/plugins-installed.ts), and nothing here imports plugin code.
 *
 * Two implementations, one contract:
 *   - the builtin registry serves the index embedded in this package
 *     (builtin-index.json — the four sandbox backends the workspace ships);
 *   - the HTTP registry fetches an `index.json` URL and runs it through the same
 *     validator, so a remote index is trusted no further than the embedded one.
 *
 * A deployment's list is the builtin registry plus the published index (see
 * NIGHTLY_INDEX_URL), merged in http/routes/plugins.ts.
