/**
 * Installing THIS server's build onto another machine, from inside the server process —
 * platform code, so the whole capability travels by hot push (see ../hmr/README.md).
 *
 * Nothing installable is produced here. The far side runs the ordinary release installer
 * ONLINE, pinned to this server's own base release, so the program tree — launchers, libs,
 * web assets, bundled runtime — is the standard artifact downloaded from the release
 * sources, exactly as a person installing by hand would get it. What this code adds is only
 * what makes the remote THIS machine's peer rather than a stock install: the hmr state
 * (harness.json + store/) is streamed across afterwards, so the remote's next boot runs the
 * same pushed platform, web and CLI this server runs (hmr/host.ts's restore).
 *
 * The remote therefore needs its own route to the release sources (GitHub or the OSS
 *  mirror); the ssh channel carries only the installer script and the store.
 *
 * The remote is left with exactly what a local install plus a push leaves: the program
 * directory, the `~/.local/bin/penguin` symlink on POSIX, and the data root's hmr/ state.
 * No sudo, no service units, no profile edits, and the rest of the data root is untouched.
