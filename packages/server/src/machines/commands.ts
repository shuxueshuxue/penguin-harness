/**
 * The exact ssh/scp invocations a remote install runs, built as argv arrays (no shell on this
 * side) plus the small commands the far side executes. Pure, so every command this app would
 * run against someone's machine is unit-visible.
 *
 * Three things run through a remote SHELL — probe, run the release installer, unpack the
 * replicated hmr store — and each has a POSIX and a Windows form, because a default Windows
 * OpenSSH session is cmd.exe, where `;`, `$VAR`, `'…'` and `rm` mean nothing. The installer
 * itself is the ordinary one (install.sh, install.ps1), downloading the pinned release from
 * the remote's own network.
 *
 * COUNT THE HANDSHAKES. A handshake to a distant or loaded host costs tens of seconds — so
 * everything rides the ONE connection ssh-session.ts holds per machine: commands, the
 * installer and the store on its stdin, every TCP connection through its SOCKS port. A POSIX
 * install is therefore the installer going in on that stdin, the same shape as the documented
 * `curl … | sh`, which is what lets the scratch directory, the scp and the cleanup
 * disappear entirely.
 *
 * Two further rules encoded here:
 * - **BatchMode.** A GUI app has no terminal: an ssh that decides to ask for a password or a
 *   key passphrase would hang forever with nothing to type into. BatchMode turns that into an
 *   immediate, readable failure — v1 is key/agent auth, exactly as the design says.
 * - **The user override rides the command line, never the config.** `-o User=…` selects the
 *   account for this connection; `~/.ssh/config` is read-only to us.
