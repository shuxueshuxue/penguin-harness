/**
 * Handing this server's Projects, and their Model config, to a machine they were given to.
 *
 * An Agent running over there calls the model endpoint from over there, so that machine
 * needs the credential. Without this, picking a model here and starting the Session there
 * fails with "Model is not in the Project config".
 *
 * The key travels inside the tunnel to the machine's own `PUT /models`, which writes it to
 * `.project_config.toml` at mode 0600 — whoever can run this already has ssh to that machine
 * and can read that file. An ordinary authenticated call rather than a far-side script: the
 * endpoint validates, invalidates cached runtimes and tells open tabs.
 *
 * MERGED, NOT REPLACED. `PUT /models` is a whole-table replace, so every remote-only entry is
 * re-sent — WITHOUT `apiKey`, since omitting it keeps the stored value and a GET reports keys
 * masked. Ours win on a collision.
