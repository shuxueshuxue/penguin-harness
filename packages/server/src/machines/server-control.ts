/**
 * Starting and stopping the INSTALLED server on a remote machine.

 * server's own shutdown endpoint, over the forward this side holds, then watching that port
 * go quiet. Neither costs a handshake.
 *
 * The remote server is a plain `penguin server` process, never supervised from here. A
 * machine that reboots simply reads as "not running" on the next probe.
