/**
 * /api/hmr/*: the hot-update surface.
 *
 * The gate middleware is the runtime half of the stop-the-world protocol:
 * requests arriving during a swap are ENQUEUED on the host's operation queue
 * (awaiting waitIdle), never rejected — a client only ever observes latency,
 * not the freeze. The routes are runtime code: they orchestrate through the
 * platform api, so they survive impl swaps unchanged.
 *
 * HMR LAYER — MECHANISM ONLY (see ./README.md). A new business API must NOT
 * become a route here. It is served by the platform itself, through the HTTP
 * seam (../hmr/http-seam.ts) that offers every request to the booted platform
 * before the runtime's own routes see it — a real route with its own path,
 * verb and status, rather than an RPC envelope clients would have to learn.
 *
 * What remains here is the upgrade channel and the status it needs, which is
 * the one thing the platform is never offered: it is how a broken platform
 * gets replaced.

   * is gzip(JSON.stringify({ platform, cli, web: { files }, source? })):
   * - `platform` — the platform's single-file JS ESM source, inline (works over
   *   HTTP alone, remote runtimes included); it must export `hotPlatform`.
   * - `cli` — the CLI's own single-file JS ESM source, inline, a SEPARATE
   *   artifact from `platform`; the server never imports or runs it, only
   *   content-addresses it into the store for packages/cli's own loader.
   * - `web.files` — a { relPath: base64 } manifest of the built web dist.
   * - `source?` — optional provenance (repo + revision), recorded but not run.
   * The server boots the platform AND installs the web dist in memory first;
   * only once BOTH succeed does it persist the version — platform, cli, and web
   * together (one atomic harness.json rename — see host.ts's persistVersion). A
   * boot failure or a bad web manifest leaves the previously committed version
   * untouched.
