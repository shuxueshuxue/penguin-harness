/**
 * THE platform: the one hot-swappable unit this build of the server packages.
 *
 * The repo carries exactly one platform — versions exist BETWEEN deployments
 * (this packaged build vs the next bundle pushed over HTTP), not as parallel
 * files. When a future build changes the context shape, it bumps `version`
 * and ships the migrator alongside the new schema; the previous shape lives
 * only in already-parked documents out in the world.
 *
 * PLATFORM LAYER — WHERE POLICY BELONGS. Anything a deployment might want to
 * change (business APIs, what an agent sees, how a capability behaves) goes
 * here rather than in the runtime, and reaches installations by one HTTP push
 * instead of a rebuild. Worth remembering when something looks like it must
 * live in the shell: this code runs INSIDE the server process, so in-process
 * effects (e.g. extending process.env for the shells agents spawn) are
 * deliverable from boot() with no runtime change. See ../hmr/README.md.
 *
 * This packaged platform carries the WHOLE business surface (see app.ts):
 * every business service and route is assembled inside create() over the runtime's
 * published capabilities, and serves through the seam in ../hmr/http-seam.ts — it
 * sees every request before the runtime's own routes do and answers null for the
 * ones it does not own. A pushed bundle therefore replaces the business wholesale:
 * adding or changing an endpoint or a service needs no runtime change.
