/**
 * The runtime→platform capability contract: what the runtime publishes through the
 * resource registry for the booting platform to claim.
 *
 * The registry is the only channel the kernel offers a booting platform (ctx carries
 * `resources`, nothing else), and everything here is published for one of two reasons:
 *
 * - it is runtime MECHANISM the platform must not re-implement (authentication, the SSE
 *   channel hub, the proxy dispatcher — a pushed bundle carries its own copy of every
 *   module, so a bundle-side `applyProxySettings` would configure the bundle's undici
 *   instance while `globalThis.fetch` still routes through the runtime's);
 * - or it is a live object that must be ONE per process (the SQLite handle — web.db is
 *   single-writer; the ServerConfig object — the listen callback writes the real port
 *   back into it and every reader must observe that write).
 *
 * What a booting platform does when the capabilities are missing or wrong — refuse, or
 * run terminals-only for a declared bare kernel — is {@link HmrClaim}'s story, below.
 *
 * There is no reverse direction here: the runtime reaches the current App through the
 * instance `hmr.ensure()` already returns (in-process api members), never through the
 * registry.
