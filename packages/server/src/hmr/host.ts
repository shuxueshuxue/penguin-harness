/**
 * HmrHost: the runtime side of the stop-the-world hot-update protocol.
 *
 * RUNTIME LAYER — MECHANISM ONLY. Nothing here may encode what the product
 * does; policy belongs in the platform, which ships by HTTP push in seconds
 * while every line in this file costs a rebuild and a redeploy of every
 * installation. Before adding anything, read ./README.md — in particular the
 * "fix where the code is" trap, which is how this rule usually gets broken.
 *
 * The host owns everything that must survive a platform swap: the resource
 * registry (live processes + their output buffers), the operation queue the
 * HTTP layer gates on, and the committed on-disk state.
 *
 * Freeze semantics: requests arriving during a swap are ENQUEUED, not
 * rejected — the HTTP layer awaits waitIdle() and proceeds once the swap
 * completes, so a client never observes the stop-the-world window (it only
 * sees latency). Concurrent upgrade requests serialize on the same queue.
 *
 * ONE atomic push, THREE independent artifacts: platform code, the CLI's
 * command implementations, and the web dist are three separately compiled
 * single-file products — there is no physical bundle that carries more than
 * one of them — but they always move together in ONE request to POST
 * /api/hmr/upgrade and land as ONE atomic version. The pushed `platform` and
 * `cli` fields are each inline ESM source (delivered as bytes over HTTP —
 * never a server-side path a remote client could not produce): `platform`
 * must export `hotPlatform` (this runtime's business unit, imported and
 * booted here); `cli` is never imported or executed by this process at all —
 * it is only content-addressed into the store, for packages/cli's own thin
 * loader to dynamically import later (see hmr/manifest.ts's
 * resolveCliBundlePath). The web dist rides along in the same request as a
 * { relPath: base64 } manifest. There is no way to update platform, cli, or
 * web independently: doUpgradeAll only commits after the platform boots
 * successfully AND the web manifest validates — a failure in either leaves
 * the previous committed version untouched.
 *
 * Web dist pushes are held in memory (a relPath → bytes map), not written to
 * disk file-by-file: a dist can be hundreds of small files, and syncing each
 * one separately serializes on the destination filesystem's per-file
 * overhead (observed as low as ~100KB/s writing 300 small files to a
 * Windows/Defender-scanned disk). The pushed bytes are persisted as ONE
 * artifact instead (see persistVersion).
 *
 * Persistence: artifacts are content-addressed under hmr/store/ (platform and
 * cli each get their own subtree, since they are no longer the same file) and
 * the whole version (platform + cli + web pointers) is promoted by ONE atomic
 * rename of hmr/harness.json — committed only AFTER the live in-memory boot
 * AND web install both succeeded, so a restart can never resume a version
 * that failed to take effect. A restart resumes harness.json as one unit (see
 * restore()): any failure — of any one of the three pieces, including a `cli`
 * pointer whose file is missing — warns and falls back to the packaged
 * default entirely (never a platform/web mismatch, never a brick). The store
 * keeps at most STORE_KEEP versions (current + one rollback) per artifact.
 *
 * CODE persists; STATE does not. Only platform code, the CLI bundle, and the web
 * dist are written to disk — never the parked context document a swap produces.
 * A restart therefore always resumes the pushed CODE, but boots it against a
 * FRESH initial context (bundle.context — see PlatformBundle below), not
 * whatever state was live when the process last exited. This is deliberate: the
 * live resources a parked doc's handles would reference (child processes, etc.)
 * die with the process anyway, so a restored doc could only ever resume as
 * "handles that fail to reclaim, nodes stuck degraded" — worse than a clean
 * boot. State DOES survive a hot swap (park → migrate → boot, entirely
 * in-memory, see kernel/upgrade.ts) — it just never survives a process restart.
 *
 * Reload is strictly request-driven: nothing watches, nothing auto-triggers.
