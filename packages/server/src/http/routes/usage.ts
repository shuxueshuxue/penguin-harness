 * Usage statistics routes:

 * (model filter is paired: provider and modelId are given together; granularity
 * sets the time-series precision, defaulting to day; fromTs/toTs bound a
 * trailing window down to instants — required for minute — and must be given
 * together);
 * GET /api/projects/:p/usage/errors?offset&limit&from&to&fromTs&toTs&agentId&kind — one page
 * of the error detail table, for paging back past the first page the dashboard already
 * returns;
 * DELETE /api/projects/:p/usage/errors?from&to&fromTs&toTs&agentId — empties that table for
 * the filter the panel is showing (owner only; `from`/`to` are required, unlike on the reads;
 * an admin's clear also takes the unattributed rows an admin's read shows);
 * GET /api/projects/:p/usage/model-totals — lifetime Token total per Model, unfiltered.
