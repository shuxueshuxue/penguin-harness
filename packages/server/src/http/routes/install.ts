/**
 * Install-identity route: `GET /api/install -> { installId }`.
 *
 * PUBLIC (no login required), and that is a requirement rather than a convenience: the web
 * app compares this id against the one in `localStorage` before React mounts, which is
 * before it knows whether anyone is signed in — and the case this whole mechanism exists
 * for, a wiped data root, is precisely the case where nobody is. See install-id.ts for why
 * publishing the id discloses nothing.
 *
 * Mounted in the PLATFORM, above its auth gate (http/app.ts's HttpModule). A hot push carries
 * platform + cli + web dist as one version and never the runtime, so putting the route where
 * the platform is puts it where the web bundle that calls it is: the two can never arrive on
 * an installation separately. The data root is still the runtime's — `deps.config.root` comes
 * from the claimed capabilities either way — so ownership of the FILE and ownership of the
 * route are simply different questions.
 *
 * The id is read per request rather than captured at boot. It is one small file and the
 * request happens once per page load, and reading it live is what makes the answer follow
 * the root: a root deleted out from under a running server reports a NEW id on the next
 * load instead of a remembered one, so the browser sweeps without waiting for a restart.
