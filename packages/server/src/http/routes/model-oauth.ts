 * `GET /api/projects/:projectId/model-oauth/callback` — where the provider sends the browser
 * back, and the ONE route of this group that does not require a session.
 *
 * It cannot require one. A loopback OAuth redirect receiver is reached by whichever browser
 * the provider redirected, which is not necessarily the one that started the flow: the
 * desktop shell hands every non-app URL to `shell.openExternal`, so the authorization page
 * opens in the *system* browser, and the system browser holds no `penguin_session` cookie
 * for `http://localhost:<port>`. Behind the global auth middleware every desktop
 * authorization therefore ended on a bare 401 while the same flow completed in the browser,
 * where the popup is a tab of the session that opened it.
 *
 * What it does without a session is deliberately less than finishing the flow: it deposits
 * the code on the flow and says so. The exchange that redeems that code and writes the key
 * runs on the owner's next poll of `GET /:flowId`, which is behind the gate — so this route
 * has no authority of its own to write a credential into a Project. A caller who learned a
 * flow id can put a code in front of that poll — but only by beating the provider's own
 * redirect to the flow's single deposit slot, and what they deposit stays inert unless the
 * owner's own session goes on to poll that flow.
 *
 * The flow id it authorizes on is a capability rather than a name: 32 random bytes minted
 * server-side, bound in ModelOAuthService to a user, a Project, a provider and a PKCE
 * verifier that never leaves this process, valid for ten minutes and depositable once. The
 * Project in the path must be the flow's own, so a flow id cannot be redirected at a Project
 * it does not belong to, and a flow opened in manual mode is refused outright — it was
 * handed no callback URL, so it has no redirect to receive.
 *
 * Mounted separately (not inside `modelOAuthRoutes`) because the exemption has to be exactly
 * this literal path: it is registered ahead of the auth middleware in app.ts, where a
 * whole-group mount would have exempted /start, /:flowId/code and the status route with it.
 * Those stay owner-only, unchanged. Only GET is served — the handler refuses the HEAD that
 * Hono re-dispatches into it rather than let a safe method spend the deposit.
 *
 * Answers HTML throughout — a person is looking at this tab, not a client parsing JSON.
