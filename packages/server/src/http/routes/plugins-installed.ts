/**
 * The plugins a PROJECT asks for, and which of them this process is actually running:
 *
 *   GET    /                      this Project's list, joined with what loaded (any member)
 *   GET    /?shipped=1             …plus which plugins the build ships (a tag)
 *   POST   / { specifier }        npm-install the package if the build does not ship it,
 *                                 add it to this Project's list, and apply (admin)
 *   PUT    / { plugins }          rewrite this Project's list, and apply (admin)
 *   DELETE /?specifier=…          drop it from this Project's list, and apply (admin)
 *
 * WHERE THE LIST LIVES. In the Project's own config (`plugins` in `.project_config.toml`),
 * beside its models — because machines are lent to Projects, so a Project's list is what
 * says which machines a plugin has to reach (PRFC-0010). The data root's old `plugins.json`
 * is not read any more, deliberately without a migration: a deployment that had one starts
 * with no plugins until each Project asks again.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY RUNS is the CLOSURE — the union over this root's Projects — because loading
 * is per process: there is one module tree. So a plugin any Project asks for is in the tree,
 * and what it contributes is visible to all of them. A row here is therefore "this Project
 * asked for it" joined with "the process has it", which are two different facts.
 *
 * APPLYING. A write re-reads the closure, rebuilds the plugin host, and asks the runtime to
 * re-assemble the App from the same bundle — no process restart, ptys and connections
 * delivered across it exactly as a push delivers them. A runtime too old to offer that
 * (`hmr.reload` absent) leaves the list written and `restartPending` true, which is the
 * behavior this route had before it could apply anything.
