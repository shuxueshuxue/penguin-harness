/**
 * Memory management (`agent_state/memory/`): the Web App's read/delete access to what the Agent
 * remembers between Sessions.
 *
 * The layout is core's (see core's state/memory.ts): one directory per scope holding Markdown
 * topic files and that scope's own `MEMORY.md` index — `memory/user/` for the User scope and
 * `memory/<workspace_key>/` for each Workspace. The User scope is addressed through the same
 * `scopeKey` parameter as any Workspace (`USER_SCOPE_KEY`), so it needs no routes of its own;
 * the one difference is that it may be created on demand, since it belongs to the Agent rather
 * than to a Session that has run.
 *
 * Per-file content changes go through a chat Session where the model edits the same files,
 * keeping frontmatter and index in step; this service's own writes are the mechanical ones a
 * model cannot be asked for. Deleting a topic file drops its `](<file>)` index lines, so the
 * index never lists a file that is gone. Whole-scope import writes the files a transfer
 * document carries and adds their index lines, the same invariant read the other way: the
 * index never omits a file that arrived. Only the indexes enter the model's context (core's
 * state/memory.ts), so an unindexed topic file would be a file the Agent never reads.
 *
 * This service never invents paths from client input — a request names an `agentId`, a
 * `scopeKey` and a file name inside that scope, each validated against a character rule and
 * then re-checked for containment after resolution, so neither `..` nor a symlink can reach
 * outside the Agent's Memory directory.
 *
 * Files are the source of truth and are read fresh on every request (they are small, requests
 * are rare, and the model edits the same files from its side).
