/**
 * Message-window scanner: the pure logic behind cursor pagination of
 * `GET /api/sessions/:id/messages` (TraceService.readMessagesPage).
 *
 * A window **unit** is one Task in the Web reducer's sense: it opens at a main-session
 * user prompt (text or image) and runs until the next such prompt. Cutting only at these
 * boundaries is what keeps every stream-model invariant intact inside a window — a
 * tool_call is never separated from its tool_call_output (outputs land before the next
 * user prompt), a compaction_begin/end span never splits (compaction-internal messages
 * stay skippable), a steering chip keeps the images that ride behind it, and a
 * mid-Task shard rotation (auto compaction with carry-over) stays glued to its Task.
 *
 * The scanner walks one shard's RAW messages (no subagent expansion — origin-carrying
 * messages never appear in a shard) and mirrors, decision for decision, the Web reducer
 * in web/src/lib/omni/stream-model.ts (pushMessage/startTask/finalizeOpenTask) plus the
 * outline-entry rule in web/src/features/chat/outline-model.ts (buildOutline) — the four
 * implementations of "what is one turn" (this file, stream-model, outline-model, and
 * trace-service.analyze) must stay in step; tests on both sides pin the shared cases.
 *
 * Two distinct counts come out of one pass:
 *   - **unit boundaries** — the safe cut points described above (banner-only prompts and
 *     goal-round re-sends included: they start Tasks in the reducer);
 *   - **outline turns** — the subset that opens an entry in the Web's conversation
 *     outline (`第 N 轮` numbering). Machine-only prompts (handoff / model-switch
 *     blocks), goal rounds past 1, steering chips and compaction injections do NOT open
 *     entries, and consecutive user messages of one send merge into one entry — the
 *     count must match buildOutline exactly, or a paginated outline would mis-number.
 *
 * The pass also accumulates the **prior stats** a partial window needs seeded into the
 * Web's stats tracker so header chips and per-turn cumulative rows keep telling the
 * truth (see task-stats.ts `seedPriorStats`): elapsed time of finished Tasks, subagent
 * token totals (via the caller-provided child expander), and the last main-session
 * session/context token readings.
 *
 * Scan state is carried across shards (a Task can span a rotation). Cached per-shard
 * prefix records (trace_files.page_stats) persist the carry so old shards are read at
 * most once ever; bump CACHE_VERSION whenever any rule in this file changes.
