/**
 * Usage statistics query.

 * Cost is **computed in real time**: usage_records only stores Tokens (pricing may

 * current Project's configured pricing — the repo returns raw Token totals broken
 * down by `(provider, model_id)` paired reference, and this service looks up each
 * reference's price once and folds it into cost / hasUncosted (if a Model has no
 * pricing, its consumption is excluded from cost and hasUncosted is flagged).
 * Summary cards (today / last 7 days / cumulative), grouped aggregation (date /
 * agent / model / session, with the session dimension supporting agentId drill-down
 * filtering), and the zero-filled time series the cost center's charts draw.
 * Server-side error statistics (error_records) ride along on the same response:
 * the statistics center fetches everything in one request, and filters are
 * naturally shared; unattributed errors (login failures, process crashes, and other
 * errors with no Project context) are visible only to admins, see the ErrorsRepo
 * file header.
