# @prismshadow/penguin-server

The PenguinHarness Web backend — the Web implementation of the SDK's Human boundary. HTTP carries Prompt input, approvals and interrupts; Server-Sent Events stream the OmniMessage output. Adds multi-user auth, Project authorization, Session runtime, scheduling and usage accounting on top of `@prismshadow/penguin-core`.

## Architecture

- **HTTP**: Hono + `@hono/node-server`; `createApp(deps)` is pure assembly (no port bind — tests drive it via `app.request()`); `index.ts` is the startup entry (dotenv, graceful shutdown).
- **Storage**: SQLite via Node's built-in `node:sqlite` (WAL) holds only indexes and aggregates (users, auth sessions, Project authorization, Agent/Session indexes, usage, UI prefs, error records). Agent State, Traces and Workspaces stay as files under `~/.penguin/data/<project>/agents/<agent>/`, fully shared with the SDK and CLI.
- **Runtime**: a session manager keeps active Sessions (get-or-resume-or-heal, per-Session mutex, run/compact driving); approvals surface over SSE as `approval_request` and decisions re-read the stored approval mode each time; interrupts converge pending approvals to deny before aborting; a scheduler fires `agent_state/schedule/*.toml` tasks while the service runs.
- **SSE**: per-channel monotonic event ids with a bounded replay buffer (1000 events / 2MB); reconnects replay from `Last-Event-ID` or receive `resync_required`; heartbeat comment every 20s.
- **Usage**: `token_usage` events are persisted row by row; costs are computed at query time from current per-model pricing.
- **Terminals**: `src/terminal/` runs pty sessions server-side (node-pty) and feeds every byte into a headless xterm, so the daemon — not the browser — owns the screen. Control is JSON over HTTP (`/api/terminals`: list / create / capture / keys / kill; create accepts `cwd`, `name`, `cols`/`rows` and a `shell` override); the byte stream is a binary WebSocket at `/api/terminals/:id/stream` (`[opcode, slot, payload]`, output coalesced into ~5ms windows with an immediate leading flush). On attach the server renders the current grid back into an ANSI restore stream, so a reload or a second device rebuilds the exact screen — scrollback, colours, cursor and DEC input modes — while the shell keeps running the whole time. The web app surfaces this twice: an in-app dock (Ctrl+` , Codex-style) and the standalone `/terminal` page (`?id=` attaches an existing terminal — the dock's detach handoff — `?cwd=`/`?name=` parameterize a new one). Sessions run in-process (no forked terminal worker); this module is the only thing touching node-pty, which is where that split would go if load ever demands it.

The full route tables and the SSE protocol are documented in the [Server API reference](https://penguin.ooo/docs/server-api). DTO types are exported for type-only import via `@prismshadow/penguin-server/api`.

## Environment

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` / `HOST` | Listen port / address | `7364` / `127.0.0.1` |
| `PENGUIN_HOME` | Data root (shared with SDK/CLI) | `~/.penguin/data` |
| `PENGUIN_WEB_DB` | SQLite file path | `<root>/web.db` |
| `PENGUIN_WEB_DIST` | Front-end build dir (static hosting + SPA fallback when present) | `../web/dist`, or the bundled `web-dist/` in the npm package |
| `PENGUIN_TRUST_PROXY` | Trust `x-forwarded-proto` (`1` to enable): it opens the hot-update network gate over proxied HTTPS and marks session cookies `Secure` — only behind a reverse proxy that sets/strips the header itself | unset (untrusted) |
| `PENGUIN_CLI_ENTRY` | CLI entry script offered to the Agents this server runs: it is written into `<root>/bin/penguin` and put at the front of every command's PATH | `penguin server\|web` and the desktop shell set it; otherwise the entry of the checkout this server was started from, when it has one |

`.env` in the process cwd is loaded automatically.

## Running

```bash
pnpm --filter @prismshadow/penguin-server dev     # tsx watch (front end via the Vite dev proxy)
pnpm --filter @prismshadow/penguin-server build   # tsup → dist/
pnpm --filter @prismshadow/penguin-server start   # node dist/index.js
```

`pnpm typecheck / test` run tsc and vitest (tests use a temp root + in-memory DB; no ports, no live LLM calls).

## Security notes (known MVP limits)

- **CSRF**: session cookie is `SameSite=Lax` and writes accept only `Content-Type: application/json`; no CSRF token yet.
- **Login throttling**: per-username exponential backoff after 5 consecutive failures (1s doubling to a 60s cap, `429 too_many_attempts` inside the window, reset on success; in-memory, so a restart clears it). Unknown usernames are throttled identically, so it is not an account-existence oracle. A reverse proxy can still add IP-level limits for public deployments.
- **Built-in admin `admin` is seeded with a random password that is hashed and discarded unseen** (`PENGUIN_SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` pins it for tests/e2e). Until a password is set, every start prints a first-login link that signs the browser in to choose one; a banner keeps reminding until the initial flag clears.
- Passwords use `node:crypto` scrypt (`scrypt$N$r$p$salt$hash`, timingSafeEqual). A session is a row in `auth_sessions` (the cookie holds a random token, the row its sha256); it survives a restart, renews the expiry in place, and logout deletes the row. Sessions run 30 days with sliding renewal.
- Model credentials live in the Project's hidden 0600 config file; the API always masks them.
- **Terminals are a shell as the OS account running the server**, i.e. the most privileged thing the API hands out — they are not Project-scoped. A terminal is only visible to the account that created it (someone else's id answers 404, not 403), and the stream WebSocket checks `Origin` on top of the session cookie because a WebSocket handshake is not subject to CORS. Do not expose a deployment with terminals enabled to accounts you would not give SSH.
- Behind a reverse proxy, disable response buffering for SSE paths (the server already sends `X-Accel-Buffering: no`), and set `PENGUIN_TRUST_PROXY=1` with `x-forwarded-proto` forwarded so session cookies are marked `Secure` — the header alone is not trusted, so without the opt-in an HTTPS deployment issues its cookies without the flag.
