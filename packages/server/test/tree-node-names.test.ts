/**
 * The node names an older runtime resolves in a pushed platform's tree.
 *
 * A tree node's NAME is a wire contract across generations, exactly like a resource id: the
 * runtime that boots a pushed platform looks nodes up by name (`createApp` in app.ts), and
 * a parked document is keyed by name too. Renaming one is therefore not a refactor — it is a
 * push that kills every older installation at boot.
 *
 * That happened: the HMR-layer rename (#636) took `RuntimeModule` with it, and a desktop
 * whose program predated the push died with `no api 'Log' on module 'RuntimeModule'` before
 * it could serve anything. These names are pinned here so the next rename has to argue with a
 * test rather than with an installation.
