/**
 * Asking a MACHINE for a session token, over ssh (machines/remote-token.ts).
 *
 * This exists because the path it replaces has a dead end: reading a machine's SEEDED admin
 * password works only until somebody sets a real one, and then that machine can never be
 * configured from here again. What authorizes a token instead is the ssh account's access to
 * the data root — access that already reads every credential on that machine by hand.
 *
 * What the token IS — that it authenticates, and only as a password session — is pinned in
 * auth-token.test.ts. What matters here is the asking: reading it out of a shell's output
 * without mistaking a login banner for a credential, and telling a machine too OLD to know the
 * command apart from one that failed. The first is "ask another way" and the caller has one;
 * the second is not, and confusing them strands every machine carrying an older build.
