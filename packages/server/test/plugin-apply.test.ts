/**
 * Applying a plugin change, after the loading moved below the seam.
 *
 * The host every surface reads from must always describe the tree that is actually running.
 * That used to be enforced by hand — the apply rebuilt a host, registered it, asked for a
 * reload, and put the old one back when the reload did not happen — and the hand-written
 * version had the bug: on a live deployment whose runtime was too old to offer `reload`, a
 * plugin read as active while nothing in the running tree contained it.
 *
 * Now the platform's own create() reads the closure and imports it, and only a create() that
 * succeeded writes the registry. So the apply carries no plugin knowledge at all, and the
 * property holds by construction — which is what these tests pin.
