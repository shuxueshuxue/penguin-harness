/**
 * The HMR layer's entry: the operations that are FROZEN.
 *
 * Everything that decides how a generation becomes current lives here and in host.ts —
 * how the first one boots, how a push is applied and what happens when its boot fails, when
 * a request may be handed to a generation, and what the layer must refresh once a new one
 * is current. The product hands in three things and drives nothing itself:
 *
 * - `host`: the store and the swap (HmrHost), built over the product's packaged bundle;
 * - `replace`: what the product does with a generation once it is current — point its
 *   handles at it, refresh what it derives from a version. Called for the first boot and
 *   after every push: the pushed generation when it lands, the previous one re-booted
 *   when it does not;
 * - `start`: the product's boot — publish what a generation claims, then the first `ensure`.
 *
 * `start` receives the control object before it runs, so the product's routes and seam can
 * be built over it while the first generation is still coming up.
