/**
 * The Trace panel's refresh rules (features/traces/trace-refresh.ts): the tab re-fetches when
 * it becomes visible and when a turn settles WHILE it is visible, never for a hidden tab, and
 * a re-fetch leaves the user's selected file where they put it — including the default they
 * never picked, and including a re-fetch that fails while they are reading.
 *
 * The panel's edges are decided by a pure tracker for the same reason the subagents panel's
 * auto-open is (panel-task-scope.test.ts): the Web suite runs in a node environment and renders
 * no React, so the rule is unit-testable only where it is separable from the effect that applies
 * it. The wiring that carries the decision into the two components is pinned at the bottom,
 * against their source.
