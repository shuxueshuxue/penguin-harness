/**
 * settings-sections.ts unit tests: which System settings pages each viewer gets.
 *
 * The rule is pinned by value rather than by shape because both halves of it can fail
 * silently and separately: a rail that shows a forbidden entry leaks that the setting
 * exists, and an active page rendered without the same filter hands a non-admin the form
 * itself. Both go through these functions, so both are covered here.
 *
 * The client filter is convenience, not the boundary — the admin APIs answer a non-admin
 * with 403 either way (server/test/admin-settings.test.ts, "non-admin access is always
 * 403").
 *
 * vitest runs node-only here (`environment: "node"`, no jsdom), so this asserts against
 * the exported functions and, for the dialog's use of them, its source
 * (account-menu.test.ts convention).
