/**
 * machines-view unit tests: what the Machines page's install control offers, given the
 * server's single install job and whatever is selected in the picker.
 *
 * Two cases worth pinning. The server runs one job at a time, so selecting a second host
 * while the first installs must refuse — without pretending the selection is the thing
 * installing. And "already installed" comes from the machine's own persisted record, never
 * from the job: reading it off the one job slot is what used to make an installed machine
 * stop looking installed as soon as anything else was installed.
