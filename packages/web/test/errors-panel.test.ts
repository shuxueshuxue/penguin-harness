/**
 * The cost center's error table and its clear action.
 *
 * Two properties a type checker cannot see. The action is offered only where it can succeed —
 * the route is owner-only, so showing it to a member would be an affordance whose only outcome
 * is a 403 — and only while there are rows to take.
 *
 * The other is the confirmation's wording, which is the whole safety mechanism here: the delete
 * is scoped to the filter on screen, so a dialog that named the Project's whole history, or
 * only the visible page, would send someone into an irreversible action describing the wrong
 * set. That sentence is a pure function for exactly this reason — this package's vitest runs in
 * `node`, deliberately, so an opened dialog is not something a test can read.
