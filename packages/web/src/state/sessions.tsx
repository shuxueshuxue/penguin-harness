/**
 * Session list context for all Agents in the current Project:
 * the sidebar groups by Agent, so all Agents' Sessions are loaded at once (fetched in parallel);
 * the chat page shares this same data for status sync / title events / self-healing reload.
 *
 * **Paged per (Agent, category)**: the default load fetches only the **active** category
 * (user-created, non-archived) plus per-category totals — archived / subagent / schedule
 * Sessions are not loaded until their collapsed folder is opened. Each pair fetches
 * SIDEBAR_PAGE_SIZE sessions per page (requesting one extra to detect "has more" — see
 * splitPage); `loadMoreFor` fetches a pair's first page when unloaded and the next page
 * otherwise (deduplicated by sessionId — new sessions shift server offsets), so every
 * category's paging is independent of the others. A reload resets each **loaded** pair
 * back to its first page (an open folder must not blank on an event-triggered refresh)
 * and leaves unopened folders unloaded.
 *
 * **Sessions are not auto-created here**: a new conversation starts as a draft (chat page `/chat/new`),
 * and the Session is only actually created when the first message is sent — after landing, the user
 * may still switch models or configure an API key first, so persisting the Session early would both
 * lock in the model and fail outright when no credential is configured yet.
 *
 * State lives in a zustand vanilla store (one instance per Provider mount); the Provider is a
 * thin lifecycle component (initial fetch, refetch on Project/Agent-set/filter changes, the
 * user-event subscription) and republishes the store's state through the same context value
 * as before. Mutations read current values via store.getState() (the old refs' job).

       * carries the other two from the server's own row; the open Session's stream calls this
       * with two arguments, having none to give.
       *
       * - `lastActiveAt` is what makes a background completion legible: the read/unread split
       *   compares it against the seen marker (session-seen.ts), so without the server's new
       *   stamp a Session that finished while the user was elsewhere would settle into the
       *   muted "already read" glyph — the exact case the user needs to notice.
       * - `hasTrace` is what keeps a FIRST run from settling into nothing at all. It separates
       *   "finished" from "never ran", and a Session running its first Task still has the
       *   `false` its list row was fetched with: the hourglass shows (status wins), and then
       *   the moment it stops the row would go blank.
       *
       * `hasTrace` is therefore treated as monotonic, and a live status is itself proof the
       * Session has run — server-side it is a one-way cache (`has_trace = 1`, never cleared)
       * set at run start, and a running Session has by definition started a Task. That second
       * half is what keeps the two callers consistent: the Session stream carries no flag, so
       * on its own it would settle a first run into a blank row until the next list fetch.
       *
       * An id no loaded page holds is dropped rather than turned into a row: the event names a
       * Session, it does not describe one, and a row invented from a status and a timestamp
       * would have no title, Agent or Workspace to render. That same drop is what filters
       * another Project's Sessions — this store only ever holds the current Project's rows.
