/**
 * Task stats row semantics (aligned line-by-line with the CLI "stats info").
 *
 * Each Task shows one stats row on completion, covering context, Token usage, and elapsed time —
 * all as Session-level cumulative values plus this-Task deltas:
 *   - Context: `request.total` from the most recent (main session) `token_usage`; delta = this
 *     Task's ending value minus the previous Task's ending value. Can be negative (compaction
 *     drop-off / provider stripping historical thinking); not clamped to non-negative;
 *   - Token: main session's latest `session.total` plus each subagent's `request.total`,
 *     Session-level cumulative; delta = sum of `total` across this Task's parent + subagent
 *     Requests (delta and cumulative share the same basis);
 *   - Elapsed: accumulated across Tasks; delta = this Task's elapsed time (= this round's last
 *     non-compaction request_end minus the first message; see stream-model).
 * Compaction attribution depends on whether it falls **within or after this round's span**
 * (test: is there still a normal Request in this round after the compaction?):
 *   - Automatic compaction **mid-round** (engine compacts then keeps running with carry-over) →
 *     elapsed time is enclosed by the span, Token / cost count toward this round (see
 *     commitPendingCompaction) — it genuinely is time and cost spent finishing this round's work;
 *   - Compaction **after round end** (wrap-up auto-compaction / manual /compact) → falls after the
 *     round's end, elapsed time and Token both excluded from this round.
 * Neither case updates the context basis or counts toward TPS (compaction is not a user request).
 * The session's `session.total` always tracks the provider (including compaction, so nothing
 * leaks at the session level; total session cost is reconciled separately server-side from the
 * session total). The compaction banner doesn't display Token.
 *
 * The stats row on the chat page reports **this round's usage** (`tokensByBucket` + `outputTps` +
 * `elapsedDeltaMs` + this round's cost) — all six answer "how much did this round cost";
 * **current context occupancy** is not duplicated in the stats row, it's shown separately by the
 * ring below the input box (`contextNow` / context window). Output TPS = this Task's main-session
 * output tokens ÷ LLM generation seconds (`taskMainOutput / taskLlmMs`, LLM duration taken from
 * paired request event wall-clock times; see stream-model).
 *
 * Pure logic module, no React dependency; driven by stream-model.ts.
