/**
 * OmniMessage stream → render view-model reducer. A
 * pure logic module, no React dependency: takes in an ordered sequence of
 * OmniMessage (history's complete messages + real-time partial/complete/
 * event), and produces a `ChatItem[]` view model (updated in place, with the caller triggering the re-render).
 *
 * Key points:
 *   - Fragment tracking: partial_text / partial_thinking are tracked by "the
 *     currently open fragment"; partial_tool_call / partial_tool_call_output
 *     are attributed to a tool card by tool_call_id. start opens it, delta
 *     accumulates, stop closes it; the subsequent complete message
 *     **replaces** the fragment's content (guaranteeing consistency;
 *     with no open fragment — mid-stream join — it's appended directly); an
 *     orphan delta (no start seen) is ignored, converging once the complete message arrives.
 *   - origin routing: messages carrying an origin go into a nested child
 *     model (surfaced in the UI as a subagent chip + the subagents panel);
 *     on a sub-session's first message it binds to "the most recent allowed
 *     (decision=allow) and not-yet-complete run_subagent tool card that
 *     hasn't been bound to an origin yet", falling back to a standalone
 *     SubagentItem if none is found; inside the nested model, the same
 *     reducer recurses (with the first origin hop stripped). Sub-session
 *     token_usage counts toward this level's stats (same convention as the CLI).
 *   - Events: approval_decision annotates the corresponding tool card
 *     (labeled "manual" if clicked on this end, "automatic" otherwise);
 *     abort → an interruption marker item; request_end ending in any status
 *     the engine reconnects on (retryable) → a retry-hint item (the engine discards that
 *     attempt and resends the original input; the next request_begin marks the hint as resent, and an
 *     arriving abort marks it as retries exhausted); other request_begin/end
 *     events aren't rendered (Request duration is covered by Trace
 *     performance analysis); compaction_begin/end → a banner item;
 *     token_usage → fed into stats (task-stats.ts).
 *   - Compaction-internal messages: model_msg within a
 *     compaction_begin↔end range (the compaction prompt and summary output)
 *     are never rendered as transcript items and never counted toward Task
 *     segmentation; the summary's own text (live partial_text fragments, or
 *     the span's complete assistant text on rebuild) accumulates onto the
 *     running compaction banner instead (issue #290);
 *     user text prefixed with `[context_summary]` is a compaction-summary
 *     injection, treated as internal input (not rendered, doesn't start a new Task).
 *   - Task segmentation: a complete text/image message on the main
 *     session's user side starts a new Task; a Task ends when the live
 *     stream receives task_state:idle (notifyTaskIdle), or — during history
 *     rebuild — when the next Task starts / the stream ends
 *     (finalizeHistory). Either way the duration comes from Trace timestamps
 *     alone and never the local clock, so a round settles to the same figure
 *     watched live and replayed after a reload. A stats row is only added if token_usage occurred during the Task.
 *   - Overlap-dedup helpers: buildDedupIndex/isDuplicate
 *     judge duplicates by exact match of the envelope JSON; when a complete
 *     message hits the dedup check, discardFragmentFor also discards the corresponding in-flight fragment.

 * pushes nothing, so the next failure's item is adjacent to the previous ladder's last one
 * while belonging to a different incident. That one restarts at attempt 1, which is what
 * separates the two cases.
 *
 * A ladder that gave up is closed and is never superseded: its line carries the final failure
 * and its detail, which is the one retry line worth keeping on screen.
