/**
 * Parses attachment lines out of user message text (for rendering in the chat UI).
 *
 * Two producers append these lines to a user message, both because the bytes cannot
 * travel in the conversation itself (see core's markers/attachment-lines.ts, which owns
 * the line format both sides share):
 *   - "[attached image: <path|URL>]" — core, when the session's model doesn't support
 *     images: the input images are written to the session scratchpad and read by path;
 *   - "[attached file: <path>]" — the server, for the composer's file attachments, which
 *     land in the same scratchpad directory.
 *
 * At render time these lines are extracted from the body text: images are turned back
 * into pictures (http(s) URLs are referenced directly; local scratchpad paths are mapped
 * to the `/api/sessions/<sessionId>/scratchpad/<fileName>` endpoint), files become a
 * banner listing their names. Both kinds are recognized only when the address is one this
 * system produced — a scratchpad path (or, for an image, an http(s) URL). Anything else is
 * left displayed as-is in the text (e.g. a "could not be saved" note, a path outside this
 * system, or a marker-shaped line a user simply typed).
