/**
 * Icon sizes and icon-to-text gaps, named by the role the mark plays rather than by a number.
 *
 * Every line icon in the app is drawn on a 24x24 grid at `strokeWidth` 1.7 and rendered through
 * `components/ui/glyph-icon.tsx`, so the only thing a call site chooses is how big the box is —
 * and structurally equivalent places must choose the same. Picking a rung by role is what keeps
 * two list rows, or two menu rows, from drifting a pixel apart.
 *
 * The two exceptions to the 24x24 grid are deliberate and stay: `ChevronDown` is drawn on a
 * 12x12 grid at 1.5, and the close cross on 14x14 at 1.5 — both are two-stroke marks whose
 * geometry is legible only when the grid matches the render size. Charts, sparklines, the
 * topology view and the login background draw their own geometry and are outside this scale.
