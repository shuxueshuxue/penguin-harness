/**
 * Which machine a terminal lives on.
 *
 * A terminal is a pty process on one machine's kernel: it is created there, its bytes come
 * from there, and killing it means killing it there. So every call about one has to reach
 * THAT machine — the same problem Sessions have, answered the same way (lib/session-machines.ts):
 * a rule over the PATH, so the call sites stay unchanged and the mapping is recorded in one
 * place, when a list hands a terminal back or when one is created.
 *
 * Absence means this machine, which is also every terminal that existed before terminals
 * could live anywhere else. In memory on purpose: it is rebuilt by the very list that
 * displays them, and a stale entry surviving a reload would address a pty on a machine that
 * may no longer hold — or no longer have — it.
