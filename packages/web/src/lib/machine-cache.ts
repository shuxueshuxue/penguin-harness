/**
 * What each machine was last seen holding, kept across a restart.
 *
 * A machine can only be asked over a held connection, and the moment this page comes up the
 * server may still be re-holding them (a hot push closes every connection its generation
 * opened; the successor brings each back). Everything built only from what answers RIGHT NOW
 * is then this server's answer alone: its Sessions in the list, and — for a workspace that
 * lives over there — no Agents at all to start one with. The remote half of someone's work
 * is simply not there, which reads as lost rather than as pending.
 *
 * So the last answer each machine gave is written down, and shown while that machine is out
 * of reach. It is replaced wholesale the moment the machine answers again — never merged,
 * because something the machine no longer has would then outlive it.
 *
 * Per machine rather than per list: this server's own answers are always available and never
 * need caching, and a machine that answers must replace ITS entries without touching a
 * neighbour's.
 *
 * Storage is best-effort in both directions. Every browser can refuse it (private windows,
 * cleared site data, storage disabled), and reading back something that no longer parses is
 * the same as having nothing — in every one of those cases the page degrades to exactly what
 * it did before there was a cache.
