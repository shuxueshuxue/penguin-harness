/**
 * The System settings dialog's pages, and who may see each one.
 *
 * Server-global pages write through /api/admin/settings (or the admin user routes) and
 * belong to admins alone; the personal pages are per-user preferences every signed-in user
 * owns. Two pages additionally depend on how this session runs: the account page only
 * exists where a password can be changed (see offersChangePassword), and user management
 * disappears in desktop mode, where the app is single-user. Updating is not a page here at
 * all — both the server check and the desktop client's live in the sidebar user menu, under
 * the entry that opens this dialog. The rules live here rather than inside the dialog
 * because this package's vitest runs in Node with no DOM — a pure function is the only
 * thing a test can pin directly — and because rail and content have to apply the same rule
 * to avoid a visible-but-forbidden entry.
 *
 * A page the viewer may not open is dropped from the list entirely rather than rendered
 * disabled: a greyed-out "Proxy" row still tells a non-admin the setting exists and that
 * someone else can reach it.
 *
 * None of this is the boundary. The admin APIs answer a non-admin with 403 whatever the
 * browser chose to render.
