/**
 * Inline help fold: a compact, self-naming row that expands its explanation underneath it.
 *
 * The sibling of InfoPopover, and one rule decides which a site gets. The circled "?" is an
 * **anchored** mark: it reads as help only because it sits immediately after a title, and it
 * borrows that title's meaning. Where a surface has no title to anchor to — an Agent settings
 * tab, whose name lives in the tab bar and is not repeated in the panel — a "?" floating alone
 * at the top of the panel is a mark modifying nothing. The disclosure then has to name itself,
 * and this is that form.
 *
 * Inline flow, not an overlay, so **no portal**. usePortalPanel earns its keep by keeping a
 * floating panel clear of an ancestor's overflow and closing it on outside click, Esc or scroll;
 * a fold pushes the content below it down and stays open until the reader folds it back, so none
 * of that applies. It is the WAI-ARIA disclosure pattern: the panel stays in the DOM and is
 * `hidden` while collapsed, which keeps `aria-controls` pointing at something real (the popover
 * cannot do that — a portaled panel only exists while open).
 *
 * The chevron is the app's one collapse indicator, the same glyph every other collapsible
 * rotates; a help fold that announced itself differently would be a second pattern for no reason.
 *
 * A lone row reads "More info" and borrows its subject from `label`. Several stacked into an FAQ
 * take `title` instead and say what each one holds, because a column of identical "More info" rows
 * tells a reader nothing about which one answers their question.
