/**
 * Chat input area: a unified input card —
 * a multi-line textarea occupies the card's top area (auto-grows; Enter sends, Shift+Enter
 * inserts a newline, image paste supported), with all controls collected onto a **single bottom
 * row** that never shares a line with the text body: attachments + approval mode (saved
 * immediately on change) + help text (to the right of approval mode) | context usage (ring
 * indicator) + Model + send (up arrow);
 * In draft state (Session not yet created), when models/onChangeModel are supplied, the model
 * selector sits to the left of the send button (provider logo + name, popup opens **downward**,
 * with a top quick-search box, an internal scroll cap to avoid overflowing the screen, and a
 * configured-key-first list with a bottom "show all" row — see ModelSelect) — once
 * the Session is created the model is locked, and the same spot switches to a read-only
 * logo + name display;
 * Draft state also renders a thinking-level picker left of the model selector (backed by the
 * Agent settings: picking a level writes through to the Agent config and applies to the session
 * created on first send); in session state the level is fixed (llmConfig is assembled once per
 * session), shown as a read-only tag from session_meta;
 * `/` opens the slash command menu (`/compact` compresses context, replacing the button; each
 * installed skill gets its own entry; pressing Enter on `/<skill_name>` toggles that skill's
 * selection without sending). Matching is positional: a slash opens the menu from any caret
 * position, running a command removes just that token, and Escape only dismisses the menu —
 * the rest of the draft is never touched;
 * `/agent` and `/model` are the two **switch** commands, both offered in an active Session
 * only — a draft has no conversation to switch, and picks its Agent and model in the draft
 * page's own selectors. Both are staged rather than immediate: running one consumes its token
 * and opens a picker (agents / models), and the pick becomes a highlighted chip above the text
 * body instead of switching on the spot. The user
 * keeps typing; **Enter/Send** performs the switch — an agent chip hands the conversation off to
 * a new chat for that agent (the current Session is not sent to), a model chip forks this
 * conversation onto the picked model. A model fork additionally waits for this Session to be
 * idle (it branches off a Trace that a run or a compaction is still appending to) and says so
 * above the composer rather than just disabling Send. With an empty text body the default
 * auto-message is filled in. Only one chip at a time (picking either clears the other, picking
 * the model already in use clears the staging, and both are exclusive with goal mode); a chip is
 * removed via backspace at the start of the text or its x button, and both are cached with the
 * draft so they survive a session switch or reload along with the text they belong to;
 * The "+" menu carries the input add-ons: image upload, file attachment (any type, several at a
 * time — they ride the task request as base64 data URLs, and the server writes them into the
 * session scratchpad and appends an `[attached file: <path>]` line to the message, so the model
 * opens them by path), and goal mode; selected files show as removable chips above the text
 * body, next to the image thumbnails, and — like images — an attachments-only message is
 * sendable with no text at all. Dragging files onto the chat area feeds the same two intakes
 * (images → paste pipeline, other files → attachments; see FileDropZone/addDroppedFiles),
 * with an overlay bounded to that region while the drag is over it.
 * The bottom toolbar provides a searchable multi-select skills dropdown (styled like the model
 * selector: a top search box filtering by name and localized description, plus a checklist;
 * clicking a row toggles its selection without closing the menu; the button = book icon + label +
 * selected-count badge, disabled while running/compacting). With skills selected, sending with an
 * empty text body is allowed — the sent text automatically falls back to S.chat.skillsAutoMessage.
 * When sent, the text body wraps in a `[use_skills]` block (the handoff's rest-of-message body is
 * wrapped the same way); the selection clears once sending succeeds. Quick-invoke pre-selects via
 * initialSkills (read once on mount; once the installed list is ready, names not in that list are
 * pruned); the slash menu also lists installed skills, and pressing Enter on `/<skill_name>`
 * selects it. The draft screen's example cards reach in through `controlRef` to fill the text
 * body and preselect their skills — a fill, never a send: the user presses Send.
 * While a Task is running the input stays enabled and the toolbar keeps ONE action button:
 * an empty composer shows Stop (abort), and typing turns that same button into Send, which
 * follows the remembered mid-run send mode — steer (delivered between turns as a
 * [user_steering] user message) or queue-as-follow-up — chosen from the "+" menu's settings
 * row (available in draft state too, persisted in localStorage); sending is disabled with a
 * reason shown while compacting.
 * The toolbar is a single left/right row: settings controls left (scrolling horizontally when
 * the card is too narrow), status + model + the action button right (never shrinking), so a
 * phone viewport never pushes the action button off-screen.
 * Renders only the card body itself: outer positioning such as bottom-docking or vertical
 * centering is decided by the page.

              steers or queues per the remembered send mode (the "+" menu's settings row).
              While COMPACTING it is always Stop: a compaction is abortable, and neither send
              channel is open then, so the alternative was a permanently disabled Send sitting
              where the only available action belonged. Idle keeps the ordinary send button.
