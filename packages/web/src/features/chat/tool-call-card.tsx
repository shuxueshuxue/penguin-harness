          Expand chevron on the right.

          Stacked sticky, second level (same as the thinking row): while this card's expanded
          output scrolls, the row pins right BELOW the stuck group header (top-4 = the
          header's -top-4 offset + its 2rem height) — the bar directly above the content is
          always the section the reader is in, never a skipped level. Opaque background for
          the stuck state; collapsing from stuck lands the view back on the row.

          The row spells out NO stop reason: it rendered `[reason]` markers (and before that,
          Badge pills) until per-user-feedback review removed them — the red text read as
          alarming repetition of what the left StatusIcon already signals. The icon plus its
          title/aria stateLabel (which still names the raw reason) is the single carrier of
          the outcome, same rule the decision wording above already follows. The known cost,
          accepted deliberately: at a glance an aborted, timed-out, malformed or auth-failed
          call all read as the icon's one failure tone, and on touch the distinction lives
          only in the expanded output (when one exists) — the tooltip/aria and the Trace
          viewer, which shows the raw stop reason per event, remain where the literal value
          belongs.

          A pending call gets no "awaiting approval" text either: the approval block below is
          always on screen while one is pending — it names the tool, shows the arguments and
          carries the Allow/Deny buttons — so the row would only repeat it. The amber hourglass
