/**
 * What the Machines page's install control offers, decided as data rather than in JSX.
 *
 * The server keeps ONE install job at a time, so the button is governed by two things that
 * are not the same: which machine is SELECTED in the picker, and which machine the job (if
 * any) belongs to. They come apart the moment someone picks a second host while the first
 * is still installing — the button must refuse, but the running job's log still belongs on
 * screen, under the alias it is actually installing to. That is why the job panel renders
 * from `state.job` directly and only the button consults the selection.
 *
 * "Already installed" is a THIRD thing, and it comes from the machine's own persisted
 * record rather than from the job: the job is one slot, so deriving it from there made an
 * installed machine vanish as soon as anything else was installed or the server restarted.
