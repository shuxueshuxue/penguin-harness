/**
 * The bridge from a "Create with AI" surface into a new conversation. The prompt is written into
 * the active new-chat draft (the cache draft-view reads on mount), the requested agent becomes
 * the current one, and the route jumps to the draft page with the request in location.state.
 * Nothing is ever submitted here: the prompt lands in the composer and sending stays the user's
 * action, so what reaches the model is always something a person read and pressed Send on.
 *
 * Typed-but-unsent text in the active draft is parked first (draft-sessions.ts) rather than
 * overwritten by the canned prompt, and the model selection carries over, as it does across
 * sends. The composed prompt itself is written as `aiPrefill` (draft-cache.ts) so that it dies
 * with the draft it seeds: nobody typed it, so it is never parked in turn, and leaving the draft
 * page without editing or sending it clears the slot.
