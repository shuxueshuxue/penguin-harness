/**
 * Model config page.
 *
 * Model entries are persisted as two independent fields, `provider` and `model_id`;
 * the (provider, model_id) pair is the entry's unique key — **zero
 * concatenation** anywhere in the pipeline, `model_id` is sent to AgentHub verbatim as the
 * upstream request id. The dialog's identity section = (group dropdown, upstream id input);
 * changing either one is a rename, submitted as a paired `renamedFrom` (the server uses it
 * to migrate the credential and pointers).
 *
 * The list is purely for "finding a model": grouped by vendor (group header = logo + vendor
 * name + count, collapsible), with one card per model within a group — the card shows only
 * the display name + status badges (default / vision / proxy-read), while
 * context, pricing, and key status are folded into a single line of small text. Clicking a
 * card opens the config dialog (credentials, context, pricing, vision toggle, plus set as
 * default / set as vision model / delete); the "add model" entry point lives in each group
 * header (owner only) and reuses the same dialog — provider is pre-filled with that group;
 * the protocol follows group semantics: a first-party vendor group doesn't persist
 * client_type (AgentHub auto-routes by upstream id, with env fallback resolved live from the
 * id), while custom / user-defined groups / gateways use a fixed OpenAI protocol, and
 * gateways (OpenRouter / SiliconFlow / Qwen Token Plan) additionally pre-fill their endpoint
 * base URL; the "get model id / API key" external links sit next to the corresponding
 * input's label (shown in both add and edit dialogs). The group list ends with an "add
 * group" action (user-defined groups share custom's semantics; the group appears once the
 * first model saves successfully — groups are carried by the model entry's provider field,
 * not persisted separately). The header also holds an owner-only "sync presets" action next
 * to the search box (union-merge with the built-in catalog, see catalog-sync.ts).
 *
 * Saving does a PUT full-table replace (models not present are deleted; an empty apiKey
 * means keep the existing value); only the owner can edit.

 * - **Import models** — fills the brand-new group from its endpoint, in the add-model

 * chips turned a row of tags into confetti; on a page whose job is scanning names, the marks
 * are meant to be noticed second.
 *
 * Three inks, so the row groups instead of enumerating: what the model IS (its default status),
 * what it CAN do, and what it COSTS. Identity is carried by the words in every case — the ink
 * only sorts them at a glance, and never alone says which mark this is.
 *
 * These are identities, not judgements, which is why they are spelled here instead of in
 * `lib/tone.ts`, whose five tones each rate a thing's state — the same reason
 * `category-colors.ts` and `update-dot.tsx` keep their own colours. Contrast against the
 * surfaces a card sits on (white and gray-50 in light; this app's overridden gray-950 `#000000`
 * and gray-900 `#0d0d0d` in dark) clears 4.5:1 for every ink; the shared border is decorative,
 * so it is not held to 3:1.

            renders for every model and stays while the field is empty (hints the shape before
            typing). Reuses the unit-adornment idiom of the context window / max tokens fields
            below; the error text sits outside the relative wrapper (see Input.invalid).

            For custom / user-defined groups that suffix IS the protocol SELECTOR (see

            clients, so picking one reuses it instead of taking a form row of its own.

            same idiom as the API key field's "get API key" link above (per maintainer). It is
            gated on the API key, and a disabled row buried inside the suffix menu could not
            say so where the user is looking.
