/**
 * Window-derived request limits (issue #218) — pure arithmetic shared by the per-request
 * output-token clamp (GenerativeModel) and the compaction-threshold derivation (Agent).
 *
 * The problem both solve: a model entry's `max_tokens` and the Agent's
 * `compaction.max_context_length` are fixed numbers, while the space they must fit into is
 * the model's `context_window` minus whatever the input already occupies. Small-window
 * models (a local vLLM with `--max-model-len 32768`, say) reject any request whose
 * `input + max_tokens` exceeds the window with a non-retryable 400 — with the seeded
 * per-Agent `max_tokens` of 32000 that is *every* request, before compaction ever gets a
 * chance to run. Everything here is derived at use from the configured values; stored
 * config is never rewritten.
 *
 * `OUTPUT_SAFETY_MARGIN` is the single tunable of the margin story: the output floor and
 * the compaction headroom are derived from it (PR #235 review), so their invariants —
 * floor below margin, headroom above margin — cannot drift apart. The two remaining
 * independent facts are `DEFAULT_CONTEXT_WINDOW` and `IMAGE_TOKEN_ESTIMATE`.
 *
 * Thinking-level interaction (considered, out of scope): on a high-reasoning session a
 * small derived cap can be consumed by thinking tokens before any visible answer, ending
 * the request as length -> failed. The arithmetic has no notion of the thinking level;
 * the compaction threshold firing `COMPACTION_HEADROOM` below the window keeps caps from
 * staying small for long, which bounds the exposure.
