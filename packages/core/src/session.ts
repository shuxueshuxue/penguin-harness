/**
 * Session — a continuous conversation context under the same Agent and Workspace.
 *
 * Human is the SDK's input/output boundary: there is no "Human
 * implementation/interface".
 *   - Input: the OmniMessage list (Prompt) passed to `run(newMessages, opts?)`, plus the abort
 *     signal `signal` and the per-call approval callback `approve` in `opts`;
 *   - Output: `run` streams OmniMessage via an async generator.
 *
 * Approval is a **within-turn interaction**: as soon as a tool_call finishes streaming, `approve`
 * is requested immediately, and it executes if allowed. Approvals for multiple tools happen one
 * at a time, but execution doesn't block the generation/approval of subsequent tools (execution
 * can overlap). GenerativeModel maintains history across turns/Tasks. A Task ends when a turn no
 * longer produces a tool_call (final reply).
 *
 * Rendering tool calls is not Session/core's responsibility: the CLI / Web frontend renders it
 * from the streamed OmniMessage on its own.
 * Docs: /docs/agent-loop; /docs/interfaces § "The Human boundary".
