/**
 * `[attached image: …]` / `[attached file: …]` — the one-line markers that hand a file on
 * disk to the model.
 *
 * Unlike this module's other markers these are not `[tag]…[/tag]` blocks and they are
 * **appended after** the user's own text rather than prefixed to it. That placement is
 * load-bearing: the origin blocks and `[use_skills]` are all parsed at index 0 of the
 * message, so a second leading block would break that chain — an attachment is a trailing
 * footnote to the message, not a new frame around it.
 *
 * Two producers write them, for the same reason (the bytes cannot travel in the message
 * itself, so the message carries their path instead):
 *   - `[attached image: <path|URL>]` — core, when the session model has no image input: the
 *     input images are written to the session scratchpad and the model reads them by path via
 *     read_file (see internal/session-support.ts);
 *   - `[attached file: <path>]` — the server, for the composer's file attachments: the upload
 *     lands in the session scratchpad and the model opens it with its ordinary file tools
 *     (see services/task-attachments.ts).
 *
 * One consumer reads them: the Web App's message renderer, which pulls the lines back out of
 * the body text and shows an image / an attachment banner instead (see lib/attachments.ts).
 * Producer and parser share the spellings below so the two can never drift apart.
