/**
 * OmniMessage — PenguinHarness's primary message protocol.
 *
 * All messages share one envelope: `timestamp` (ISO 8601 UTC), `type`, and `payload`.
 * The outer `type` falls into three categories:
 *   - `session_meta`: Session metadata;
 *   - `model_msg`: model input/output messages (both complete messages and streaming
 *     `partial_*` messages);
 *   - `event_msg`: control/statistics events during execution.
 *
 * Trace records only: `session_meta`, complete `model_msg`, and all `event_msg`;
 * the Human interface communicates using: complete `model_msg`, streaming `partial_*`, and all
 * `event_msg`.
 *
 * Docs: packages/docs/content/omni-message.{zh,en}.md (site path /docs/omni-message) documents
 * this protocol payload-for-payload — keep the page in sync when changing types here.

/**
 * The reason a model response or message generation ended. Only six protocol values are
 * allowed:
 *   - `completed`: finished normally, including completed text, thinking, tool requests, or
 *     tool output;
 *   - `completed`: the request (or the segment it closed) ended normally;
 *   - `aborted`: user-initiated interruption or cancellation;
 *   - `retryable`: a failure worth retrying — transport drops, timeouts, 408/429/5xx,
 *     malformed or truncated responses, and anything unclassifiable. The engine reconnects
 *     on its backoff ladder; the specific error rides on `error_message`
 *     (`LLMOutcome.errorMessage` / `request_end.error_message`), never on the reason value;
 *   - `fatal`: a failure no retry can fix — a provider 4xx rejection (invalid request,
 *     quota, and the credential failures of `isAuthenticationError`) or a deterministic
 *     client-side rejection (fast mode on a model without a fast tier). The engine stops
 *     the run and surfaces the error; the fix is a config/credential change, then a new
 *     request.
 *
 * The one vocabulary every stop_reason-carrying record shares — model messages, tool
 * results, request and compaction terminals alike. Tool executions rarely have a
 * retryable failure: a tool error or timeout is definitive for that call and is fed back
 * to the model as a `fatal` result (nothing in the harness retries it), with `retryable`
 * available for genuinely transient tool situations.
 *
 * Legacy Traces may still carry the retired values `failed` / `timeout` / `malformed` /
 * `auth` on their records; replay logic only ever compares against `completed`, and render
 * layers keep read-only handling for the old spellings.
