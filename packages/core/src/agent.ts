/**
 * Agent and the `createAgent` entry point.
 *
 * `createAgent` is the unified way to create/load an Agent: it initializes Agent State
 * if the directory is empty, otherwise loads by agentId.
 * An Agent has exactly one Agent State and can run multiple times; the
 * Workspace is determined when a Session is created.
 *
 * A Session runs on **model contexts**, each assembled from the Agent State as it is on disk
 * the moment the context opens — Session creation, the context a completed compaction opens,
 * a resume that finds its context closed — and fixed until the context closes (see
 * `assembleContext`). The Agent object's own `state` is the load-time snapshot, used for
 * identity and initialization; no Session runs on it.
