/**
 * @prismshadow/penguin-core — public entry point for the PenguinHarness core SDK.
 *
 * Exports the OmniMessage protocol, the three interface contracts (Human/LLM/Environment),
 * and the runtime entry points for Agent / Session / context_engine along with their
 * submodules (state / llm / environment / trace).
 *
 * Typical usage:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const agent = await createAgent({ agentId: "default_agent" });
 * // A model reference is always the (provider, model_id) pair; omit both for the Project default.
 * const session = await agent.createSession({ workspaceDir, provider, modelId });
 * for await (const output of session.run([userText("...")])) { ... }
 * ```
