 * message carries attachments, no text, and a staged handoff: its only text message is the
 * origin block. Such input therefore falls through to the line-only message, leaving the block
 * intact. Prefix blocks (`[use_skills]`, `[scheduled_task]`) are parsed at index 0 and keep
 * their own body, so they still take the lines as usual.
 *
 * Exported from the package barrel because the server writes `[attached file: …]` lines for
 * the composer's uploads and must place them exactly the same way — one rule, so a message
 * carrying both kinds of attachment still reads as a single trailing block.
