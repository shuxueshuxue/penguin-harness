 * BuiltinTool abstraction — lets Environment avoid special-casing any specific tool name.

 * `execute`. Environment dispatches purely by looking up `name`; an unknown tool collapses to an
 * explanatory `tool_call_output`, never throwing. Adding a new tool later (e.g. file read/write,
 * retrieval) only requires implementing this interface and registering it with the registry, with
 * no changes needed to Environment.

 *   are optional (Environment ignores the tool's start/stop and frames it itself), and there's
 *   **no need** to produce a complete `tool_call_output` either (the complete message,
 *   maxOutputLength forward truncation, and close-out are all derived by Environment from the
 *   deltas). If a tool does produce a complete `tool_call_output` anyway, Environment uses it as
 *   the basis for content and stop reason (tolerated for compatibility, not recommended).
 * - **Nested forwarding**: yielding any message **tagged with origin** is passed through by
 *   Environment unchanged (e.g. run_subagent forwarding all of a child session's messages).
 * - **Stop reason**: reported via the generator's return value (defaults to completed); a throw
 *   is collapsed by Environment into aborted/failed based on interruption/error, never
 *   propagating up as an exception.
