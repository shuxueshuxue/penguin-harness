/**
 * Variables **removed** from the child environment (removed, not blanked: a program that
 * checks `PORT` for presence rather than value must see nothing at all).
 *
 * `PORT` / `HOST` are stripped because they are never about the command being run. On the
 * serving paths they are the harness's own listener: `penguin web` / `penguin server` write both
 * into their own `process.env` as the channel to the server module (see the CLI's `startServer`).
 * On the CLI-only paths (`penguin run`, `penguin chat`, the REPL) nothing listens at all, but the
 * CLI still loads `dotenv/config`, so a `PORT` there is the one the *user's own project* picked
 * for *its* server. `npm run dev`, Vite, Next and most Express templates read `PORT`, so either
 * way an inherited value makes a server the Agent starts bind a port it was never asked to take —
 * the harness's own in the first case, one already spoken for in the second. A command that needs
 * a particular port should be told so in its own invocation (or through the vault), never by
 * ambient inheritance.
 *
 * `PENGUIN_CLI_ENTRY` is internal plumbing: the CLI uses it to tell the server which script to
 * re-run for self-update. It means nothing to any other program and leaks the install path.
 *
 * `PENGUIN_WEB_DIST` is *not* internal — it is a documented deployment override (see the
 * configuration reference and the server README) — and is stripped anyway because it names this
 * installation's front-end build. In the self-development case an Agent that starts a
 * PenguinHarness server would otherwise serve the deployment's assets instead of the ones it just
 * built in the workspace, silently and with no error to read.
 *
 * `FORCE_COLOR` / `CLICOLOR_FORCE` are color-forcing overrides that Node (and the chalk-family
 * libraries) deliberately let defeat `NO_COLOR`, so an inherited value would cancel the
 * `NO_COLOR=1` + `TERM=dumb` hardening above and leak ANSI escapes into tool output (#102).
 * Removal, not blanking, matters here too: Node reads an *empty* `FORCE_COLOR` as "force 16
 * colors on". The vault still wins, so a user who genuinely wants forced color in commands can
 * set it there.
 *
 * Every `PENGUIN_*` variable is removed as well — see {@link HARNESS_ENV_PREFIX}. That covers
 * `PENGUIN_HOME` and `PENGUIN_WEB_DB`, which select the *data* an Agent-started harness works
 * against. They were once left inheriting on the grounds that the self-development case may
 * legitimately want the same data root, but inheriting them is not that decision being made — it
 * is an accident of where this process happens to be running. Whenever an Agent spawns a command
 * the harness is by definition up, holding `<root>/server.lock`, so an Agent-started server on the
 * inherited root cannot start at all; it exits 3 against a lock whose owner is the very process
 * that handed it the root.
 *
 * Any of it really wanted is asked for rather than inherited: the vault is applied after this
 * environment (see the spread in `spawn`), so a `PENGUIN_HOME` set there reaches commands exactly
 * as before. Same escape hatch as `FORCE_COLOR` above.
