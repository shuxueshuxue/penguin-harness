/**
 * ManagedSession — runtime state and collection logic for a single command session.
 *
 * Spawns the process with the shell `sessionShell()` picked — `bash -lc <cmd>` wherever a bash
 * exists, its fallback chain otherwise (see shell.ts) — with stdout/stderr going through plain
 * pipes (no native dependency, clean output; an interactive program that detects no TTY falls
 * back to non-interactive mode, which parses more cleanly for the Agent anyway). `detached`
 * makes the child process the process-group leader, so both Ctrl-C and killing the whole group
 * rely on **process-group signals** (a signal to `-pid` also reaches background child processes).
 * Windows has neither process groups nor real signals: every "signal" degrades to a hard
 * TerminateProcess, and tree-wide cleanup goes through `taskkill /t` instead (see signalGroup).
 *
 * Key semantics:
 * - **Termination is determined by the foreground process exiting (the exit event, waitpid
 *   semantics), not by waiting for stream EOF**: background child processes that inherit the
 *   pipe don't hold things up;
 * - `collect(yieldMs)` **streams** output deltas within the budget: data is yielded as soon as it
 *   arrives, without waiting for the window to end; if the command exits mid-window, the trailing
 *   output is yielded along with it (with a capped drain window); if it's still running once the
 *   window expires, whatever output exists is yielded and collection ends, with the process
 *   switching to background; if `signal` aborts, whatever output exists is yielded and collection
 *   ends immediately;
 * - Unread output has a cap (memory safety); when exceeded, the oldest part is dropped and
 *   counted, with a marker shown on read;
 * - `kill()` sends SIGTERM to the process group, then SIGKILL after a grace period, reaping any
 *   leftover background child processes; idempotent.
