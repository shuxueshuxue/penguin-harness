/**
 * ManagedSubagentSession — a subagent session capable of running in the background.
 *
 * Holds a `SubagentHandle` and drives its `run` (pump): the same child Session may run across
 * multiple rounds (the first round is initiated by `run_subagent`, later rounds append a Prompt
 * via `input_subagent`). Structurally mirrors a command session (ManagedSession): the parent tool
 * call collects output live within the yield window; output produced outside the window (while
 * running in the background) goes into a buffer, delivered all at once on the next access.
 *
 * Three kinds of output, each with its own destination:
 * - **Message buffer**: all of the child session's OmniMessage (already tagged with origin), for
 *   the parent tool call to forward to the frontend for rendering; capped in count, overflow
 *   drops the oldest (only affects frontend replay — the child Session's own Trace loses no
 *   data);
 * - **Text buffer**: assistant text deltas from the direct child layer (origin one hop), fed back
 *   as the parent tool's own output to the LLM; capped in capacity (prevents memory bloat),
 *   overflow drops the oldest with a marker;
 * - **Approval queue**: the child session's tool approval requests. While running in the
 *   background, the parent session may have no active tool call to forward approval through, so
 *   the request is queued and the child session blocks waiting; the parent tool call
 *   (run_subagent / input_subagent) attaches an approval sink (`attachApprovalSink`) within its
 *   window to consult Human one request at a time — if detached mid-consultation (window ends),
 *   the request stays queued, and a late-arriving decision still takes effect (settled guard,
 *   first to arrive wins).
 *
 * Mid-run control: `steer` queues a message on the child Session's own steering queue (the
 * mechanism a user steers the main session with), and `abortRun` aborts only the current
 * round via a per-run AbortController — the session survives both for follow-up prompts.
 * The model (input_subagent) and the host (subagents panel) converge on these same methods.
 *
 * Cleanup: `kill()` aborts the current run via AbortSignal, denies all pending approvals, and
 * releases child Session resources; idempotent. The child Session runs in-process, so there's no
 * need for a separate synchronous hard-kill path (its command sessions are reaped by their own
 * exit fallback); `killHard` is equivalent to `kill`.
