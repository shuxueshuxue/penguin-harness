/**
 * What the Environment side needs: the contract `context_engine` executes an approved tool

 *
 * Two planes live in this file and must not be confused (see the docs page):
 * - the **message plane** — `executeTool`, which the engine drives: an OmniMessage tool call
 *   in, a stream of OmniMessage out, nothing else;
 * - the **management plane** — the tool list, the permission lookup, the background command
 *   and subagent listings, their stop/steer entry points and the listener attachments. These
 *   never pass through `context_engine`: they serve a host's own UI (the Web App's process
 *   and subagents panels, an approval mode's permission check) and are ordinary method calls
 *   returning ordinary data.
