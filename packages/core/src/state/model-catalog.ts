/**
 * Built-in model catalog (single source of truth): official chat models that AgentHub can
 * auto-route, shared by core's default config, server's initial config, and web/cli display.
 * Data verified as of 2026-07-10 (Qwen Token Plan entries: 2026-07-20; MiniMax: 2026-08-03;
 * DeepSeek, Gemini 3.7, GLM-5.3 and the whole OpenAI line-up (direct + OpenRouter):
 * 2026-08-18; the direct Anthropic group: 2026-08-20; the DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision Exp rows:
 * 2026-08-21; the TokenDance group: 2026-08-25, its glm-5.3-flash row: 2026-08-26, its
 * qwen3.8-flash row: 2026-08-27 and its running promotions plus the hy4-preview rows
 * (TokenDance + OpenRouter): 2026-08-28; the GLM-5.3 Flash rows (direct + OpenRouter) and
 * the direct qwen3.8-flash: 2026-08-26; the TokenDance Doubao Seed rows (seed-2.1-pro,
 * seed-2.1-turbo, seed-evolving): 2026-09-02; the vLLM group: 2026-09-03; the direct DeepSeek
 * V4 Flash rows (flash and flash-vision-exp): 2026-09-08, for the official adjustment
 * effective 2026-09-10; the GPT-6 Astra rows (direct + OpenRouter): 2026-09-09; the
 * pre-registered deepseek-v4.1-flash row: 2026-09-09, from DeepSeek's release announcement;
 * the whole Gemini 3.x line-up, direct + OpenRouter — the 3.6 / 3.7 / 3.8 Flash launch
 * discounts declared, every other row re-read and unchanged: 2026-09-09 — per each
 * provider's docs).
 * Docs: packages/docs/content/models.{zh,en}.md (site path /docs/models) documents the
 * provider groups and credential resolution described here.
 *
 * Three-bucket pricing convention (USD per million tokens, matching usageToTokenCounts'
 * token-to-bucket mapping):
 * - cache_read: the vendor's "cache hit" price;
 * - cache_write: the vendor's "cache write" price (e.g. Anthropic uses 1.25 x input); vendors
 *   without a separate cache-write fee use the standard input price;
 * - output: output price (thinking + reply).
 * OpenAI charges extra for >272K input, Gemini 3.1 Pro for >200K input, and MiniMax M3 doubles
 * every rate above 512K input; this catalog records their base tier (the cost center uses a
 * single rate, so long-context usage will be underestimated).
 *
 * Scope: excludes deepseek-chat / deepseek-reasoner legacy aliases that AgentHub cannot
 * auto-route (deprecated 2026-07-24), glm-5v-turbo (AgentHub's GLM client forwards images
 * only for glm-5.3-flash, so a vision model cannot do the one thing it exists for), the
 * OpenRouter z-ai/glm-5.1 and SiliconFlow Pro/zai-org/GLM-5.1 gateway listings
 * (delisted 2026-08-06; the Z.AI direct glm-5.1 remains), the OpenRouter
 * inclusionai/ling-3.0-flash:free listing (delisted from OpenRouter, removed 2026-08-18),
 * non-chat models (embedding / image generation / TTS), and Bedrock. Direct-vendor ids are
 * auto-routed by AgentHub and leave client_type unset; the six gateway groups (OpenRouter,
 * Fireworks AI, SiliconFlow, TokenDance, Qwen Pay-As-You-Go, Qwen Token Plan) can't be
 * auto-routed, so every gateway row **always pins an explicit client_type** and inlines its
 * preset base URL. The vLLM group pins one too, but as a property of the GROUP rather than
 * of each row (ModelProviderInfo.clientType, read through providerClientType): a model the
 * user adds there speaks the same protocol as the presets, and has no preset base URL to
 * inherit — see the group's own block comment.
 * That pin is load-bearing, not decoration: AgentHub's AutoLLMClient matches raw substrings
 * against `client_type || model_id` and never looks at base_url, so an unpinned gateway id
 * would be routed by its own spelling — `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` would reach the first-party
 * GPT-5.6 client aimed at a gateway, and `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8` would throw outright
 * (dotted "4.8" matches neither "4-8" nor "-5"). Two protocols are pinned:
 * - `openai-chat` for most rows (AgentHub 0.4.2's canonical name for the generic Chat
 *   Completions client — the bare "openai" spelling is a deprecated upstream alias, see
 *   canonicalClientType);
 * - `openai-responses` for the OpenRouter `openai/*` rows, whose upstream really is an
 *   OpenAI Responses server (see the OpenRouter block comment for why only those rows);
 * - `openai-chat-vllm-adapter` for the vLLM group, which is Chat Completions on the wire
 *   but maps the thinking level onto the served model's own chat template
 *   (VLLM_CLIENT_TYPE).
 * The MiniMax M3 preset pins AgentHub's first-party `minimax-m3` protocol and direct API
 * endpoint.
 *
 * App attribution (`attributionHeaders`, bottom of this file) rides alongside the protocol
 * pins: it names PenguinHarness to the gateways that read such a header, keyed on the
 * endpoint host rather than on the provider group.
 *
 * This file imports no Node built-ins (type-only imports only), so it can be bundled directly
 * for the browser.

  // one pass on 2026-08-07 from the models API (/api/v1/models; the API is authoritative
  // where a model's web page disagrees); the DeepSeek rows, the rows added on 2026-08-18
  // (gemini-3.7-flash, grok-4.6, deepseek-v4-pro-0813, glm-5.3, the openai/* additions) and
  // every pre-existing openai/* and google/* row were re-read on 2026-08-18 from the model
  // pages and the per-model endpoints API.
  //
  // Protocol: rows pin `openai-chat` except the `openai/*` rows, which pin
  // `openai-responses` - OpenRouter serves the Responses API at {base}/responses (the same
  // https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 base URL these rows already carry), and AgentHub 0.4.2
  // verified that pairing live. The switch is deliberately limited to the OpenAI family:
  // OpenRouter will translate /responses for any upstream, but the Responses client leans on
  // OpenAI-specific reasoning-item round-tripping (replaying encrypted_content / signature /
  // summary and the assistant `phase`), which is only guaranteed when the upstream is
  // genuinely OpenAI. Non-OpenAI rows therefore stay on Chat Completions.
  //
  // Price buckets: cache_read stores the published input_cache_read
  // (falling back to the input price for the rows without one — the :free rows and the
  // GPT Pro tiers, which publish no cache discount); cache_write stores
  // input_cache_write only when it is a genuine per-token write premium (the Anthropic, GPT
  // and qwen3.8-max rows, 1.25x input) —
  // Gemini's field is an hourly cache-STORAGE rate, not a per-token price, so those rows
  // keep the input price — and otherwise also carries the input price. The :free tier and
  // the openrouter/free Free Models Router store a genuine $0 price (not "unknown"), so
  // costs correctly compute to 0. GPT models are uniformly vision-capable (OpenAI
  // product-line policy) even where the gateway page omits the modality.
  //
  // Discounts: what these rows record is what OpenRouter actually BILLS, so a gateway
  // promotion is stored at its discounted rate (unlike the direct-vendor rows, which keep the
  // list price). The Gemini 3.x Flash rows are the exception: the promotion they sit on is
  // Google's own dated launch discount rather than the gateway's, so they keep the list price
  // and declare it in `discount`, exactly as their direct-vendor twins do. The endpoints API
  // exposes the running promotion as `pricing.discount` on the default endpoint; rows sitting
  // on one say so and name the rate to restore, because a lapsed promotion silently doubles
  // the real cost — that is exactly how the gpt-5.6-terra and gpt-5.6-luna rows drifted 2x
  // low before the 2026-08-18 re-read. --

  // Every row prices at zero, and omits two other things, all because the user runs the server:
  // - **zero pricing**. There is no seller charging per token: what the deployment costs is
  //   the operator's own hardware, which no catalog rate could express. Three zero buckets are
  //   the same genuine $0 tier the `:free` gateway rows carry, so these models show the free
  //   badge and contribute 0 to the cost center rather than the "unpriced" mark — which is the
  //   truthful reading of a self-hosted endpoint that bills nobody.
  // - **no base URL**. Every deployment has its own; the user supplies it, as in `custom`.
  // - **no auto-routing**. Each row pins openai-chat-vllm-adapter explicitly, and the pin is
  //   load-bearing twice over: `Qwen/*` matches none of AutoLLMClient's substring rules and
  //   would be rejected outright, while `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-*` contains "deepseek-v4"

  // contextWindow is the recipe's NATIVE length, which is the most a deployment can serve
  // without reconfiguration; an operator may serve less (`--max-model-len` below the native
  // limit) or, for the Qwen rows, far more with YaRN rope scaling. The catalog cannot know

 * answer is too. This mirrors AutoLLMClient's branch order exactly (the same discipline as
 * resolveModelEnv above) and reports what the selected client does with the parameter:
 *
 * - maps it -> the protocol, and the toggle may be offered;
 * - raises UnsupportedParameterError (gemini3_7, glm5_3, kimi_k3, deepseek_v4,
 *   openai_embedding, and claude5 on Bedrock or a Claude 4.6 id) -> `undefined`;
 * - routes nowhere (AutoLLMClient throws for an id it cannot place; there is no openai_chat
 *   fallback) -> `undefined` as well, since a model that cannot run has no fast tier either.
 *
 * A rule rather than a per-model list on purpose: catalog rows added later inherit the right
 * answer without anyone remembering to update a table.
 *
 * Routing reads `(clientType || modelId).toLowerCase()`, exactly as AutoLLMClient resolves it,
 * so an entry that pins no client_type self-routes on its model id - which does not always
 * agree with its provider group (`anthropic/claude-fable-5` with a blank client_type reaches
 * the native claude5 client, not openai_chat, and the dotted `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8`
 * matches no branch at all). The two claude5 carve-outs are therefore checked against the raw
 * `modelId` / `baseUrl`, not against the routing token: the client tests its own `_model` for
 * `"4-6"` and its base URL for the `bedrock://` prefix.
 *
 * `"anthropic"` is reported for every Claude the client serves, including ids outside the
 * research preview's Opus allowlist: Anthropic answers those with a 429 at request time, which
 * is something to warn about before enabling, not grounds to hide the setting.
 *
 * Two runtime inputs stay invisible to a pure function of the config and can still flip the
 * answer: the server's `CLIENT_TYPE` env var overrides the entry's client type, and
 * `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` supplies the base URL when the entry leaves it blank (so a `bedrock://`
 * there sends Claude to Bedrock, which has no fast tier). Third-party OpenAI-compatible
 * endpoints are a third: they accept `service_tier` and may quietly serve the standard tier.
 * That residue is why llm/generative-model.ts still handles the rejection at runtime.
