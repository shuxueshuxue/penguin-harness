/**
 * Project config storage (`<project>/.project_config.toml`).
 *
 * Records the available Models, the default Model, and each Model's credential (Model
 * is decoupled from Agent — the Model selection isn't stored in Agent State, but maintained by
 * the Project). Config is persisted as TOML.
 *
 * `.project_config.toml` is the Project's **single config file**: a hidden file (not shown by
 * default `ls`), written to disk with mode 0600; credentials (api_key / base_url) are **inlined
 * on the model entry** rather than split into a supplementary area and a separate secrets file.
 * It can only be read/written via the system interfaces (CLI / Web) — never hand-edited by the
 * model or the user; the system Prompt is forbidden from reading this file, `loadProjectConfig`
 * returns plaintext, and masking is applied at the interface layer (when shown by server / cli).
 *
 * Model references are **fully split into separate fields**: an entry stores
 * `provider` and `model_id` as two independent fields, with the `(provider, model_id)` pair as
 * the unique key — string concatenation like `<provider>/<id>` is forbidden anywhere in the
 * pipeline. `model_id` is the upstream request id, sent to AgentHub unchanged; `default_model` /
 * `vision_model` are paired `{ provider, model_id }` references (a TOML inline table).
 *
 * A caller always supplies the **complete pair**: `provider` is never guessed from the builtin
 * catalog and never derived from whichever configured entry happens to carry the same
 * `model_id`. Both halves or neither — a `model_id` without a `provider` is an error, not a
 * lookup, because resolving it would silently point credentials and pricing at a vendor the
 * caller never named.
