 * substantively, bump the kernel". A kernel update never consults it as history: a stored tab
 * equal to the current default short-circuits before any lookup.
 *
 * **Advancing the kernel** — what the pinned-hash test asks for when a default changes, and
 * the whole of the appending workflow. Set `KERNEL_VERSION` to today's date (a second change
 * the same day reuses it), then, per tab the test names, with the hashes from
 * `computeKernelTabHashes(defaultSystemConfig())`: append the tab's **old** hash here to the
 * end of its `KERNEL_SUPERSEDED_TAB_HASHES` entry (creating the entry if this is its first
 * change), then write the new hash in. Then add a line to the generation list below saying
 * what moved. Never edit a hash already superseded: it is a frozen record of what shipped.
 *
 * The generations behind the record, oldest first (the dates are kernel versions; matching is
 * purely by hash, so a stored date never has to line up with anything):
 *
 * - `2026-08-10` — the generation *before* the prompt-injection toggles (PR #257): no `vault`
 *   / `skills` / `schedules` sections, and the default template carried the hardcoded legacy
 *   # Vault / # Skills sections instead of the `{{VAULT}}` / `{{SKILLS}}` / `{{SCHEDULES}}`
 *   placeholders. The date is a retroactive label (configs of that era carry no stamp). This
 *   is where the record starts; anything older cannot be reconstructed at all — those tabs
 *   match no recorded hash and are conservatively kept, with restore-default-config as the
 *   recourse. Only the prompt tab has a hash here: the three missing sections are absent
 *   rather than superseded, and the runtime / tools / memory tabs still shipped what the
 *   toggles generation shipped.
 * - `2026-08-11` — the toggles generation: the `vault` / `skills` / `schedules` sections
 *   appeared and `system_prompt` took the placeholder template (prompt tab).
 * - `2026-08-18` — `run_subagent` gained the optional `thinking_level` argument (issue #306):
 *   the tools tab moved.
 * - `2026-08-19` — the `max` thinking level joined the ladder, widening `run_subagent`'s
 *   `thinking_level` enum: the tools tab moved again.
 * - `2026-08-20` — the seeded `compaction.max_context_length` rose to 256000, with the
 *   per-model `context_window` cap as its backstop: the runtime tab moved.
 * - `2026-08-21` — background execution: `exec_command` / `run_subagent` gained
 *   `run_in_background`, `input_command`'s empty-poll default became 120000ms, and the
 *   `kill_command` / `kill_subagent` tools joined the set, moving the tools tab; alongside
 *   them the memory prompt was reworded to name when a fact is worth saving (PR #397), moving
 *   the memory tab.
 * - `2026-08-24` — the kill notion left: `kill_command` folded into `input_command` as its
 *   `kill` parameter, `kill_subagent` was removed outright (a subagent session is never
 *   destroyed — `input_subagent` resumes a released id), and `input_subagent` gained `abort`
 *   and now returns the subagent's latest reply: the tools tab moved.
 * - `2026-08-26` — the schedules prompt's default target became the Session the
 *   model is already in (`session_id` taken from the Environment section) instead of a fresh
 *   Session per trigger, alongside the hygiene line that bounds a self-directed recurring task
 *   and the carve-outs from the new default (an open-ended reminder keeps no `end_at`, work
 *   that must outlive the conversation takes the new-Session form, and a subagent omits the
 *   field): the schedules tab moved.
 * - `2026-09-01` — `model.timeoutMs` rose to 300000: the value is the idle budget between
 *   upstream events, and a model that keeps its reasoning off the wire spends its whole
 *   thinking phase inside the wait for the first one, which 120000 cut short. The runtime tab
 *   moved.
 * - `2026-09-03` — the default system prompt's # File system section gained a
 *   search-scope rule: searches run from `CWD` down, never `find /` and never across the
 *   user's home or the whole filesystem, and a path that does not resolve is narrowed by
 *   reasoning about the project's layout instead of by widening the root. The prompt tab
 *   moved.
 * - `2026-09-10` (current) — image reading folded into `read_file`: the `read_image` /
 *   `describe_image` entries left the set, `read_file` gained the optional `prompt` argument,
 *   an image-aware description and a 60000 timeout, and `input_command`'s timeout aligned
 *   with `exec_command` at 120000 (its empty-poll default became 110000): the tools tab
 *   moved.
