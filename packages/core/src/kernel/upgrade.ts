/**
 * The upgrade ladder, MVP slice: silent → migrator chain → blocked.
 *
 * "Data is not discarded" is machine-decided by strictParse over the parked
 * document (after running per-node migration chains). Any dropped/missing/
 * invalid path blocks the swap: the old instance keeps running untouched and
 * the caller receives the parked doc plus the exact paths — the input for the
 * next rungs of the ladder (auto-upgrader / agent / human), which live outside
 * the kernel.
 *
 * Validate-then-swap: the running tree is only disposed after the whole
 * document reconciles. Boot itself can still fail after the dispose — that
 * residual risk is surfaced as a RETURNED outcome (`status: "failed"`, carrying
 * the parked document), never a throw: the caller holds everything needed to
 * re-boot the previous implementation from that document, so the worst case is
 * an automatic recovery boot, never data loss and never a half-dead process
 * whose old tree is disposed with nothing booted in its place.
