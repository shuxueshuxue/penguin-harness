/**
 * Preflight for `pnpm --dir packages/desktop start` (and the root `pnpm desktop`) and for
 * every `pack*` script: verify everything a source run needs, and fail with the actual fix
 * instead of a bare ENOENT from the utilityProcess fork or an empty plugin library. A source
 * run loads the same bundles a packaged app does, so all of them have to exist first — and
 * a pack needs the same set, because electron-builder copies what exists and says nothing
 * about a `from:` source that does not (the web build above all).
