/**
 * Per-form app identity — pure, no Electron imports, so it unit-tests under plain
 * vitest.
 *
 * A dev shell must be able to run while an installed release build is running (#292).
 * "Dev" is a *profile* — an instance identity plus its default data root — and not the
 * same thing as being unpackaged: an unpackaged run defaults to it, and a packaged
 * build opts into it with `--dev`, so one installed exe can also run as a second,
 * isolated instance. What stays keyed on `app.isPackaged` is capability, not identity:
 * whether there is an installed artifact to update or a bundled CLI to install. Electron keys everything that must stay per-instance on the app
 * name: the userData directory holds the Chromium profile and this shell's state
 * files (server-port, preferred-port, cli-install-offered), and the single-instance
 * lock is derived from it — under a shared name a second launch does not open a
 * second app, it quits into the running instance's window. A dev-suffixed name
 * therefore separates the whole set at once (own profile, own sticky port, own
 * instance lock) and doubles as the visible marker of which instance is which (the
 * macOS app menu label follows app.name).
 *
 * The Windows AppUserModelID splits the same way: Windows groups taskbar buttons and
 * routes toast notifications by AUMID, so a dev run must not claim the installed
 * app's identity. (Dev toasts may not render without an installed shortcut carrying
 * the dev AUMID — acceptable for a source run; the release value keeps matching what
 * electron-builder stamps on the installed shortcuts, see electron-builder.yml.)
 *
 * Tripwire for whoever edits main.ts's imports: Electron resolves the userData path
 * once, on the first read, and caches it — so `app.setName()` only relocates anything
 * while nothing has read it yet. ESM evaluates every import before main.ts's first
 * statement, which means a module-scope `app.getPath(…)` anywhere in the import graph
 * would silently pin userData to the package name and undo this whole split. Verified
 * safe today, including updater.ts's eager `electron-updater` construction; keep any
 * new `app.getPath` call inside a function.
