title: Sessions & Traces
description: The six-level run model, local data directory layout, Trace file design, and Session recovery.
---

All PenguinHarness runtime data lives on the local file system: configuration is editable files, history is append-only Traces. This page defines each level of the run model and explains how the Trace serves as history, recovery source, and statistics source at once.

## Run model

Six levels: Project → Agent → Workspace → Session → Task → Request.

| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Project | Top-level unit organizing Agents; owns the model and credential configuration; in the multi-user Web setup, users and Projects are many-to-many |
| Agent | The executing subject; has exactly one Agent State (a persistent directory); one Agent can serve many Workspaces |
| Workspace | The working directory of one run — the only file scope the model sees; an explicit `workspaceDir` must already exist, otherwise a temporary Workspace `workspaces/tmp-<8hex>` is created |
| Session | A continuous conversation under one (Agent, Workspace); model and Workspace are locked at Session creation; ids look like `session-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-<8hex>` |
| Task | One execution goal started by one Prompt; consists of one or more consecutive Requests |
| Request | One LLM API call: context and tool definitions in, streamed output out |

See the [Architecture](/architecture) page for how the levels cooperate, and the [Agent Loop](/agent-loop) for how Requests advance within a Task.

## Data layout

The data root is the `PENGUIN_HOME` environment variable, defaulting to `~/.penguin/data`. The layout is defined in one place, `packages/core/src/state/paths.ts`:

```text
<root>/<project>/
├── .project_config.toml          # Project-level models & credentials (hidden file, 0600)
└── agents/
    └── <agent>/
        ├── agent_state/              # system_config.yaml, AGENTS.md, .vault.toml,
        │                             # tools/, skills/, schedule/
        │   └── memory/               # Memory: user/ plus one directory per Workspace,
        │                             # each with its own MEMORY.md index
        ├── traces/
        │   └── <yyyy-mm-dd>/<sessionId>_<index3>.jsonl
        ├── scratchpad/               # temp files, one subdirectory per Session id (e.g. pasted images)
        ├── shared_env/               # shared interpreter/tool environments (virtualenvs, pipx,
        │                             # caches) the Agent creates on demand — a system prompt
        │                             # convention, not a path the code creates, so tooling is
        │                             # installed once for any task; project dependencies stay
        │                             # in the project
        ├── workspaces/               # temporary Workspaces (tmp-<8hex>)
        ├── benchmarks/               # capability Benchmark cases and scores
        └── snapshots/                # Agent State version snapshots
```

See the [Configuration Reference](/configuration) for the fields of each config file.

## Trace design

A Trace is an append-only JSON Lines file; each line is one OmniMessage envelope (see the [OmniMessage Protocol](/omni-message)). History is only ever appended, never modified in place.

- One Trace file corresponds to one complete model context. When compaction produces a new context segment, the writer rotates to a new file — `_002`, `_003`, … — with an incrementing index.
- Recorded: `session_meta`, complete `model_msg`, and all `event_msg`.
- Not recorded: streaming `partial_*` fragments (the producer appends the complete message once the segment ends), and nested messages tagged with `origin` — a subagent's messages go to the child Session's own Trace, while the parent Trace keeps a single `subagent` pointer event at the spawn site recording the child Session id.
- `request_begin` and `request_end(status)` come in pairs delimiting one Request; replay uses `request_end.status === "completed"` as the commit criterion for that turn.
- Appends are serialized inside the writer: records from concurrent producers (the model stream, parallel tool executions) land strictly one after another, each as a single uninterrupted line — a multi-megabyte record such as a base64 image Data URL can never be torn apart by a concurrent append, and file rotation never splits a record.
- Each record is appended with a single `write(2)` (not `fs.appendFile`, which splits payloads larger than 512 KiB into multiple underlying writes), so an abnormal process exit can at most truncate the last record — it can never tear one apart in the middle. Before Session resumption continues an existing file, the writer probes the file tail: if a previous crash left a torn line (no trailing newline), the next record is preceded by a newline, so the torn line never swallows the records appended after it.

See `packages/core/src/trace/writer.ts` for the implementation.

The head of a Trace (illustrative; one OmniMessage envelope per line):

```jsonl
{"timestamp":"2026-07-18T03:10:22.531Z","type":"session_meta","payload":{"session_id":"session-2026-07-18-11-10-22-3f8a1c2d","provider":"deepseek","model_id":"deepseek-v4-pro","model_context_window":1000000,"system_prompt":"…","tools":[…],"agent_state":"/home/u/.penguin/data/default_project/agents/default_agent/agent_state","workspace":"/home/u/work"}}
{"timestamp":"…","type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"request_begin"}}
{"timestamp":"…","type":"model_msg","payload":{"type":"text","role":"user","text":"Create hello.txt"}}
{"timestamp":"…","type":"model_msg","payload":{"type":"tool_call","role":"assistant","name":"exec_command","arguments":"{\"cmd\":\"printf hi > hello.txt\"}","tool_call_id":"call_0"}}
{"timestamp":"…","type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"approval_decision","decision":"allow","tool_call_id":"call_0"}}
{"timestamp":"…","type":"model_msg","payload":{"type":"tool_call_output","role":"user","output":"[no output]","tool_call_id":"call_0"}}
{"timestamp":"…","type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"request_end","status":"completed"}}
{"timestamp":"…","type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"token_usage","session":{…},"request":{…}}}
```

When tool output exceeds `maxOutputLength`, Trace records the same bounded head, truncation marker, and absolute Session recovery path seen by Web/CLI and the model; it does not separately duplicate the archived text. The path exposes the host data-root layout but remains valid across Tasks and Session resume because the unredacted recovery file lives in that Session's scratchpad. The existing explicit Session-deletion path removes the scratchpad and recovery file together. Trace replay therefore faithfully restores both what the model saw and a usable pointer for later follow-up.

## Session recovery

The Trace is the single source of truth for recovery — there is no separate session database to keep in sync. `resumeSession` works as follows:

1. Locate the highest-index Trace file of the Session;
2. Read the runtime configuration from its `session_meta` — the model and the Workspace, immutable for the lifetime of the Session, and the system prompt and thinking level that context opened with;
3. Replay the committed history into a fresh LLM context;
4. Reconstruct the carry-over (undelivered tool outputs, interruption markers) plus turn and Token counters;
5. Continue appending to the same Trace file.

Recovery requires that the Workspace and the model still exist. What recovery guarantees is structural legality: only committed turns are replayed, with `tool_call` / `tool_call_output` pairing intact; incomplete model output (thinking, text) is allowed to be lost. A truncated last line left by an abnormal process exit is tolerated and ignored; a malformed line in the middle of a file (e.g. in a file damaged before writer appends were serialized) is skipped with a diagnostic on stderr, and every parseable record is kept. See `packages/core/src/trace/resume.ts`.

Special case: if the latest Trace file ends with a completed compaction, that context is closed as a whole — resume starts from an empty context; in summarize mode the `[context_summary]` is reconstructed and prepended to the first input after resume (old Traces using the earlier angle-bracket `<summary>` form are still understood). That empty context is opened like any context a compaction opens: assembled whole from the current Agent State — prompt, toolset, vault and run settings — rather than from the closed file's recorded prompt (see [Compaction](/agent-loop)). An open context, by contrast, keeps the prompt its file recorded; its tools, Environment and vault can only come from the current Agent State, since the Trace records no executable configuration.

## Model switch (/model)

The Web's `/model` command changes models the way the `/agent` handoff does: picking a model stages it in the composer, and sending creates a new Session under the same Agent via the ordinary session-creation API (the chosen model, **the source session's Workspace** — so files stay reachable), and the first message opens with a `[model_switch_from]` source block — the source session id, the absolute path of its latest Trace file, the Workspace, and the previous model pair — followed by whatever the user typed. The history is **not injected** into the new context: some models require thinking payloads and `fidelity` byte-for-byte when history is replayed, which cannot cross models — instead the model reads the source Trace file itself (JSONL, one message envelope per line) when it needs the earlier context. The source session and its Trace are untouched.

## Field fidelity

Each content message's opaque provider `fidelity` payload (thinking signatures, phase labels, encrypted reasoning, …) is preserved verbatim in the Trace and sent back verbatim — some models require it byte-for-byte on history replay, and any rewriting would break compatibility. This is one reason the Trace stores raw OmniMessage envelopes rather than a post-processed format.

## Observability

Every approval decision (`approval_decision`), abort (`abort`), compaction (`compaction_begin` / `compaction_end`), and `token_usage` lands in the Trace as an event. The Web Trace view and the usage/cost statistics are both derived from this same data — there is no second source of truth — and priced by the same rule: the Project's current rates for the model, at the tier each request's own timestamp fell in, so a Trace file's per-turn costs add up to what the conversation toolbar and the cost center show for the same requests; see the [Web App Guide](/web-app). The approval mechanism itself is covered in [Tools & Approval](/tools). Trace files can also be moved across deployments: a conversation's Trace panel exports the selected file (downloaded verbatim as JSONL), and System settings → General imports one back under an Agent — an import whose session id already exists under that Agent is rejected, so an imported file always becomes index 001 of a new Session.
