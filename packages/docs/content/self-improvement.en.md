description: The Skill-orchestrated Benchmark and optimization loop: score, improve, snapshot, roll back.
---

Self-improvement in PenguinHarness uses Skills to orchestrate the ordinary Agent machinery: evaluations are ordinary Sessions and optimization is ordinary file editing. Evaluation construction and optimization run in two independent top-level Sessions, while individual evaluations are delegated through the built-in `run_subagent` tool. Top-level prompts provide the Agent, Benchmark, capability, score, and round settings for the task; Skills own call relationships, calibration, Freeze, protocol, repair, rollback, and reporting.

## Roles and call relationships

| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Builder | Top-level Agent that directly follows `agent-initialization` and then `benchmark-design` |
| Target Agent | The Agent being improved; runs evaluation tasks only inside its own Workspace |
| Evaluator | Leaf worker created through `run_subagent`; runs and scores one Benchmark Case run |
| Optimizer | New top-level Agent that directly follows `agent-optimization` |

The Builder and Optimizer directly follow their Skills in their own top-level Sessions. Evaluators are created through `run_subagent`; each follows `agent-evaluation` and uses the Penguin CLI to launch the specified Target Agent in an isolated Workspace identified by an absolute path. The Penguin CLI launches the Target Agent for the requested Case run.

## Two independent steps

The first top-level Session creates the Agent and its capability evaluation. The Builder first uses `agent-initialization`, then uses `benchmark-design` to build a multi-Case Benchmark. It may build the complete initial Case set before Pilot 1 and may refine multiple Cases or difficulty dimensions in a later iteration. The evaluation contract and private standard must be clear and fixed, while the public Statement need not uniquely determine the Gold. A Benchmark may use incomplete public information, conflicting signals, and a fixed private decision standard when that standard expresses a reusable policy, priority, or inference boundary and is not rewritten after seeing the run's answer.

Before the first dispatch of every new or changed Case, the Builder checks that the Statement is internally coherent, the Rubric agrees with the current Statement and fixed private standard, and every scoring item relies only on defined, provided, or explicitly private premises; this does not require the public materials to reproduce the private standard. It repeats the full review across all Cases before Freeze. Most points should rest on decisions or concise artifacts for which the intended behavior and a plausible shortcut produce different results, rather than giving a high floor for format, evidence enumeration, or analysis completeness.

Before each calibration dispatch, the Builder predicts the result produced by the observed Trace strategy, the different result produced by the desired behavior, and the score range affected. Adding another public rule, exception, source, or check that the model can directly execute does not automatically increase difficulty. If both strategies still reach the same scored result, the Builder chooses another refinement.

Every Pilot iteration runs each Case exactly once. The Pilot score is a desired target: meeting it permits an early Freeze; otherwise the Builder completes the configured number of valid Pilot iterations and freezes the lowest-scoring valid revision. The Builder temporarily retains only the current lowest valid revision and its complete result. After the final consistency review, it records that selected Pilot's one-Run result directly as the Formal Baseline without rerunning or backfilling more Runs, then removes the temporary copy and other calibration scaffolding. A Formal score that misses the desired target does not invalidate the Benchmark.

After the user confirms that step is complete, they start the second top-level Session in a new conversation and specify `runs` per Case for every Candidate. The Optimizer checks the Benchmark and its first complete Formal Baseline before following `agent-optimization`:

1. orchestrate Evaluators in parallel through `run_subagent`, covering the Case × user-specified `runs` matrix;
2. use scores and linked Traces to propose one bounded Candidate;
3. edit the Target Agent's editable state — `AGENTS.md`, Skills, config — to produce version N+1;
4. keep the Candidate only when its Evaluation score strictly improves; otherwise roll it back;
5. stop early when the desired score is reached, or complete the configured number of valid Candidate rounds and retain the highest-scoring Reference.

Invalid evaluations and correction reruns do not count toward the round limit. On an execution failure, the Optimizer keeps the same Candidate and repairs only the missing cell; it keeps trying while each attempt follows a new diagnosis and applies a distinct safe repair. Both Builder and Optimizer validate that the complete Evaluator response is plain protocol YAML before reading status or score; if formatting is invalid, that same Evaluator resends from its existing result without rerunning the Target Agent.

Every accepted Candidate is appended to and verified in the Scoreboard immediately. A strictly higher Evaluation score decides acceptance; the first comparison directly compares the Candidate's multi-Run average with the Formal Baseline's one-Run score without backfilling the Baseline. Whether the predicted Case behavior changed is reported separately so unrelated single-run variation is not presented as causal evidence. Agent optimization requires a complete Formal Baseline in the Scoreboard — without one there is no improvement to compare against.

## From the Evaluation Center

The Web App's Evaluation Center starts the same two Sessions without a hand-written prompt. **Create with AI** takes the Test Agent and a description and prefills the `benchmark-design` request — agent id, a desired baseline score, a pilot-iteration limit — into a new conversation with the Project's default agent; **Create manually** writes a Benchmark from a form in the layout below, ready for evaluation. **Optimize with AI** and **Optimize manually** are the same pair of buttons, and prefill the `agent-optimization` request — Test Agent, Benchmark id, runs per case, round limit, target score — into a new conversation with the optimizer agent of your choice. Both only prefill: sending is the user's decision in that conversation. The evaluation runtime is never chosen there: the Optimizer reuses the pair and thinking level the baseline recorded.

## Benchmark storage

Benchmarks are stored per Agent under `benchmarks/<id>/`:

```text
benchmarks/<id>/
├── benchmark_config.toml       # Benchmark configuration (Builder runs is fixed at 1)
├── <case-id>/
│   ├── statement/              # the task given to the Target Agent
│   └── rubric/                 # private scoring rubric, isolated from the Target Agent
└── scoreboard.yaml             # evaluation records (current format)
```

The separation of `rubric/` from `statement/` is deliberate: the Target Agent sees only the task statement and never touches the scoring rubric.

`benchmark_config.toml` is what makes a directory a Benchmark: a directory under `benchmarks/` without one is not listed. Deleting a Benchmark while an evaluation is still running leaves such a directory behind, because the running evaluation keeps writing to the paths it was deleted from. A Benchmark that has simply never been evaluated still has its config and is listed as usual; a leftover directory is safe to delete by hand.

Each evaluation record in `scoreboard.yaml` is timestamped and carries:

- the evaluation runtime: a user-specified `(provider, model_id)` pair takes priority, otherwise the pair is inherited from the Builder Session; `thinking_level` is read from the Target Agent config and does not depend on Trace metadata;
- `summary_title` and `summary` (the round's conclusion and the hypothesis for the next one);
- Score, cost, and duration averages written by the model — Case-level values average Runs and Evaluation-level values average Cases; Run cost preserves its recorded precision, cost averages ignore `null` inputs and remain `null` only when every contributing cost is unknown; Score uses two decimals, cost averages use six decimals, and `duration_ms` is an integer;
- per-Case run details, each run recording `score`, `cost`, `duration_ms`, and `session_id`.

Every Run and every Case has a fixed maximum Score of 100, so Scoreboard entries do not carry `max_score`. The server and Web UI trust the stored aggregate values and do not recompute or cross-check them. Old Scoreboard formats are not migrated or backfilled.

The built-in `default_agent` ships with an example Benchmark (`packages/core/src/state/example-benchmark.ts`) so the evaluation pages have data out of the box; the whole directory can be deleted or replaced at any time.

## Snapshots and versions

Before each optimization round, the Agent State is packed into `snapshots/v<version>.tar.gz` (excluding the Vault — secrets never enter a snapshot). The `version` in `system_config.yaml` increments on successful optimization. The Web UI supports exporting and importing snapshots; importing a version not higher than the current one requires explicit confirmation. A new Agent can also be created straight from an exported package in the Agents page's create dialog: it starts with the package's state and version, no confirmation needed.

## Auditable end to end

- Every Evaluator run is an ordinary Session with a full Trace;
- Scoreboard records link back to those Sessions via `session_id`; see [Sessions & Traces](/sessions-and-traces);
- The Web evaluation pages are read-only views of these files; the trend chart shows Score only, while the detail table shows model ID and thinking level as separate columns. See the [Web App Guide](/web-app).

Scores are not black-box output: every number can be traced back to the run that produced it.
