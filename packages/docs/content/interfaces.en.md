title: Core Interfaces
description: A top-down tour of the contracts — full LLMInterface and EnvironmentInterface signatures, inner types field by field, and every swappable seam.
---

The context_engine depends on three interfaces: Human, LLM and Environment. All protocol conversion happens inside the implementations — the engine sees only [OmniMessage](/omni-message). This page goes top-down: the two big interface signatures and the Human boundary first, then each interface's inner types layer by layer. All types are exported by `@prismshadow/penguin-core`; source: `packages/core/src/interfaces/` — `llm.ts` (what the model side needs), `environment.ts` (what the Environment side needs), `shared.ts` (the vocabulary both genuinely need), and `index.ts`, the barrel behind the `@prismshadow/penguin-core/interfaces` subpath.

```

| Interface | Contract | Built-in implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Human | `session.run`'s inputs and streamed output | CLI, Server (SSE) |
| LLM | `LLMInterface.streamGenerate` | `GenerativeModel` (over AgentHub) |
| Environment | `EnvironmentInterface.executeTool` et al. | `Environment` + the builtin tool registry |

Two iron rules run through every interface: **never throw into the engine** (errors converge into messages/returns carrying a `stop_reason`), and **the streaming discipline** (`start → delta → stop`, complete message immediately after).

### Message plane and control plane

The **content** crossing all three boundaries is OmniMessage and nothing else — `session.run`'s input and streamed output, `streamGenerate`'s input array and yielded stream, `executeTool`'s approved call and its output stream, a subagent round's input and its forwarded messages, and every Trace write.

What travels *alongside* it is the **control plane**, deliberately not message-shaped, because none of it is conversation content:

| Control-plane item | Where | Why it is not a message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `signal: AbortSignal` | `RunOptions`, `GenerativeModelParameters`, `ToolExecutionRequest` | An interruption that had to wait its turn in a message queue would not be an interruption. |
| `thinkingLevel` | `GenerativeModelParameters` | A per-request parameter, like a timeout — it says how to run the request, not what to say. The engine holds the live value as its own state (`ContextEngine.setThinkingLevel`, fed by the `Session.thinkingLevel` setter — the soft-limited knob); unset, the LLM object's construction default — the context's opening level — applies (`RunOptions` carries no level). |
| `approve` and its `ApprovalDecision` | `RunOptions`, `ToolExecutionRequest` | The callback takes an OmniMessage tool call; the answer is a three-value enum the engine turns into an `approval_decision` message the moment it has it. |
| `LLMOutcome` | `streamGenerate`'s generator return value | The request's terminal state, which the engine's retry and reconnect policy branches on. A generator's return value is statically guaranteed to exist; "the last message yielded must be a `request_end`" would only ever be a runtime convention. The engine writes that `request_end` from it. |

Everything else that is not OmniMessage is Environment's management plane, described below.


## LLMInterface

The complete model-side contract is a single method:

```ts
interface LLMInterface {
  streamGenerate(parameters: GenerativeModelParameters): AsyncGenerator<OmniMessage, LLMOutcome>;
}

interface GenerativeModelParameters {
  newMessages: OmniMessage[];    // only this turn's new messages (the impl owns history; mixed roles rejected)
  signal?: AbortSignal;
  thinkingLevel?: ThinkingLevelName;   // per-request override; omitted = the construction default
}
```

The generator yields `partial_*` fragments and complete messages, emits Token usage as `token_usage` events, and reports the terminal state via its **return value** (not a yielded message).

### LLMOutcome semantics

```ts
interface LLMOutcome {
  status: StopReason;   // completed | timeout | malformed | aborted | failed | auth
  message?: string;     // failure detail: on failed/auth, and on timeout/malformed when a
                        // concrete error was caught — carried onto request_end so the
                        // errors panel shows the real reason behind a retried request
  permanent?: boolean;  // marks a failed as deterministic (client-side rejection thrown before
                        // any network I/O, e.g. fast_mode on a model without a fast tier):
                        // the engine aborts with the message instead of retrying
}
```

| status | Meaning | Engine reaction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `completed` | finished normally (token_usage already emitted) | proceed |
| `timeout` | timeout / transport disconnect | auto-reconnect within the run |
| `malformed` | response parse failure | auto-reconnect within the run |
| `failed` | an error the classifier did not judge transient (params, …) | auto-reconnect within the run as well — the status is still reported as `failed`. Exception: with `permanent: true` (a deterministic client-side rejection, e.g. fast mode on a model without a fast tier) the run stops immediately with the message |
| `aborted` | user interrupt | stop, hand back to the user |
| `auth` | credentials rejected | stop, hand back to the user — the one LLM status that never retries; hosts gate input until the model's API key is updated |

Implementation constraints: never throw; no internal retries — reconnecting is the engine's job (see [The Agent Loop](/agent-loop)).

### GenerativeModelConfig

The built-in implementation's init config, field by field:

```ts
interface GenerativeModelConfig {
  modelId: string;
  apiKey?: string;
  baseUrl?: string;
  clientType?: string;             // AgentHub client protocol (openai / …); inferred from modelId when omitted
  tools: ToolDefinition[];
  systemPrompt?: string;           // fully assembled system prompt, placeholders substituted
  contextWindow?: number;
  maxTokens?: number;
  fastMode?: boolean;              // per-model fast mode (AgentHub fast_mode; premium faster tier), off by default
  thinkingLevel?: ThinkingLevelName;   // construction default (a per-request parameter can override); "none" | "low" | "medium" | "high" | "xhigh" | "max"
  requestTimeoutMs?: number;       // Request idle budget: the longest wait for the next upstream event, default 300000; <=0 disables
  toolCallIds?: ToolCallIdAllocator;   // Session-level tool_call_id registry (pass the same instance across compaction)
}
```

### The built-in implementation: GenerativeModel

`GenerativeModel` (`packages/core/src/llm/generative-model.ts`) grounds the contract on the `AutoLLMClient` of the `@prismshadow/agenthub` model gateway:

- the gateway maintains conversation history **statefully**, receiving only new messages each turn; resuming a Session replays committed history through a one-time `setHistory`;
- an internal `EventTranslator` translates gateway stream events into `partial_*` fragments plus complete messages, preserving each item's opaque `fidelity` payload verbatim; segmentation mirrors the gateway's own aggregation — a thinking block is closed by its fidelity payload and a run of equal fidelity stays one block (OpenAI-compatible clients stamp every delta with the same `{ reasoning_field }`, which must not split blocks), while a text segment splits on a differing `fidelity.phase` and closes on a `fidelity.signature`, fidelity keys accumulating on merge; complete messages settle in thinking → text → tool_call order;
- every request asks the gateway for thought summaries (`thinking_summary`), which no provider rejects — it is dropped where the family has no such thing, and read as "summarized thinking" by the Claude family. Besides letting the reader watch the model reason, it keeps events arriving during a reasoning phase, which is what `requestTimeoutMs` measures: the timer runs only while awaiting the next upstream event, resets on each one, and never counts consumer-side time (yielding, approvals, Trace writes), so it bounds silence rather than the length of a response;
- `ToolCallIdAllocator` disambiguates providers that use the function name as the call id (append `#n` inbound, strip outbound), scoped to the whole Session;
- provider differences (tool-call formats, reasoning content, streaming events) are absorbed entirely inside the gateway — see [Models & Providers](/models).

## EnvironmentInterface

The complete tool-execution contract:

```ts
interface EnvironmentInterface {
  listTools(): Promise<ToolDefinition[]>;
  executeTool(request: ToolExecutionRequest): AsyncGenerator<OmniMessage>;
  toolPermission(name: string): "r" | "rw" | undefined;   // for frontend approval-mode decisions
  dispose?(): void;                                        // release runtime resources; idempotent
}
```

This interface carries two planes, and only the first one belongs to the agent loop:

- the **message plane** — `executeTool`, the one method `context_engine` ever calls here: an OmniMessage tool call in, a stream of OmniMessage out;
- the **management plane** — `listTools` and `toolPermission`, plus the optional background-command and subagent members (the listings, `killBackgroundCommand`, `sendToBackgroundSubagent`, `abortBackgroundSubagentRun`, the listener attachments and `dispose`). None of these pass through the engine: they serve Session assembly and a host's own UI — the Web App's process and subagents panels, an approval mode's permission lookup — and are ordinary method calls returning ordinary data. That is why they are not message-shaped, and why widening them would not make the engine's boundary any purer.

`executeTool` yields `partial_tool_call_output` fragments and ends with exactly one complete `tool_call_output`; `origin`-tagged nested messages (e.g. forwarded by `run_subagent`) pass through unchanged. The built-in Environment can keep truncated text in the Session scratchpad without exposing storage lifecycle hooks through this public interface. Its model-visible recovery path is a plain absolute path; on Windows it is written with forward slashes, which Node's fs APIs and the package's (Git) Bash tool shell both accept, so the same spelling works as a `read_file` argument and inside shell commands. Rendering is explicitly not this interface's concern — streaming rendering belongs to the CLI / Web front ends.

### ToolExecutionRequest and EnvironmentConfig

```ts
interface ToolExecutionRequest {
  toolCall: OmniMessage<ToolCallPayload>;   // an approved call
  signal?: AbortSignal;
  approve?: ApproveFn;                      // forwarded to tools that spawn child Sessions (approval inheritance)
}

interface EnvironmentConfig {
  workspaceDir: string;
  toolConfig: ToolConfig;                   // { customTools: ToolDefinitionConfig[]; mcpServers: MCPServerConfig[] }
  sessionScratchpadDir?: string;            // this Session's scratchpad (scratchpad/<sessionId>); enables truncated-output recovery
  services?: EnvironmentServices;           // runtime services injected into individual tools
  vault?: Record<string, string>;           // Vault env vars, injected into exec_command / input_command subprocesses
  proxyEnv?: () => ProxyEnvPolicy | null;   // command-subprocess proxy policy; re-read per spawn, absent or null = pass through
}

// "strip" removes HTTP(S)_PROXY/ALL_PROXY (NO_PROXY kept); "inject" forces the explicit
// proxy over the inherited env: HTTP(S)_PROXY (+ lowercase twins) = url, NO_PROXY = noProxy
// (supplied pre-merged by the caller), inherited ALL_PROXY removed. Vault entries still win.
type ProxyEnvPolicy = { mode: "strip" } | { mode: "inject"; url: string; noProxy: string };

interface EnvironmentServices {
  subagentRunner?: SubagentRunner;          // needed by run_subagent
  visionDescriber?: VisionDescriberService; // injected for text-only models only: read_file describes images through it
  commandSessions?: CommandSessionManager;  // long-running command session registry (built by Environment)
  subagentSessions?: SubagentSessionManager;// background subagent session registry (likewise)
  backgroundDone?: (event: BackgroundTaskDoneEvent) => void; // completion-report sink for run_in_background launches (likewise)
  backgroundForward?: (msg: OmniMessage) => void;           // live message tap of a background subagent (likewise)
}

interface MCPServerConfig {
  name: string;                             // tool-name prefix: discovered tools appear as mcp__<name>__<tool>
  config: Record<string, unknown>;          // stays an open object at this seam; typed at assembly time by
                                            // environment/mcp into a transport description (stdio / http / sse),
                                            // see /tools § MCP Servers
}
```

`Agent.createSession()` and `resumeSession()` pass the Session scratchpad directory
automatically. A standalone embedder that owns a stable per-Session directory opts in by
supplying it — no archive-specific type is exposed:

```ts
const environment = new Environment({
  workspaceDir,
  toolConfig,
  sessionScratchpadDir, // e.g. <dataRoot>/<project>/agents/<agent>/scratchpad/<sessionId>
});
```

### The inner tool contract: BuiltinTool

Inside the Environment, an individual tool follows a deliberately narrower contract ("loose tool, strict framework"):

```ts
interface BuiltinTool {
  name: string;
  definition: ToolDefinitionConfig;
  execute(
    args: Record<string, unknown>,
    ctx: ToolExecutionContext,       // { workspaceDir, toolCallId, signal?, approve? }
  ): AsyncGenerator<OmniMessage, ToolResult | void>;
}

interface ToolDefinitionConfig {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  parameters?: Record<string, unknown>;   // JSON Schema
  permission?: "r" | "rw";
  forModel?: "vision" | "text-only";      // assembled per session-model class (unset by the built-in entries)
  timeoutMs?: number;                     // default 120000; <=0 disables
  maxOutputLength?: number;               // default 16000, head-kept truncation; <=0 disables
}
```

A tool emits only content deltas; framing, timeouts, truncation, `stop_reason` priority and errors-to-messages are all handled centrally by the Environment — it is close to impossible for a tool author to break the protocol. Extension is registration: add one `name → factory` entry to `BUILTIN_TOOL_FACTORIES` (`packages/core/src/environment/tools/registry.ts`). Per-tool parameters and behavior: [Tools & Approval](/tools).

## The Human boundary

Human is deliberately not an interface class. The SDK caller *is* the Human:

```ts
const session = await agent.createSession({ workspaceDir, provider, modelId });

session.run(
  newMessages: OmniMessage[],                    // input: the Prompt
  opts?: RunOptions,
): AsyncGenerator<OmniMessage>;                  // output: streamed OmniMessage

interface RunOptions {
  signal?: AbortSignal;    // interrupt (e.g. Ctrl-C)
  approve?: ApproveFn;     // per-tool approval; denies everything when omitted
}
```

The CLI wires terminal I/O onto this boundary; the Server wires HTTP requests and SSE channels onto it. Any programmatic caller that connects becomes a new Human implementation — nothing to register.

## ApproveFn

```ts
type ApprovalDecision = "allow" | "deny" | "forbidden"; // "forbidden" = the command policy's veto
type ApproveFn = (toolCall: OmniMessage<ToolCallPayload>) => Promise<ApprovalDecision>;
```

Constraints: called exactly once per complete `tool_call`; a throwing callback counts as `deny`; when none is injected the engine denies everything (conservative default). A Subagent inherits its parent's approval callback (invoked with an `origin` tag), so the approval policy spans the whole delegation tree.

`"forbidden"` is never a host's answer: `Session.run` wraps the injected callback with the [Project command policy](/configuration#command-policy), and a vetoed command answers `"forbidden"` before the host is asked at all. The denial output is one fixed `aborted` line either way — "Tool call denied by user." for `"deny"`, "Tool call denied by policy." for `"forbidden"` — and the decision value itself rides the `approval_decision` event, so the Trace names the decider with no extra field. An existing callback returning `"allow"` / `"deny"` needs no change.

## Subagent interfaces

Subagent creation is injected at the `createAgent` composition layer, so the Environment never back-depends on the layers above it:

```ts
interface SubagentRunner {
  // Precheck errors (depth limit, unknown agent) are thrown — Environment collapses them to failed
  spawn(input: {
    agentId?: string;     // defaults to the current Agent (self-spawn)
    modelId?: string;     // paired with provider; both omitted = inherit the parent Session's model
    provider?: string;    // required whenever modelId is given (a model reference is the pair)
    thinkingLevel?: ThinkingLevelName; // omitted = inherit the parent Session's effective level
  }): Promise<SubagentHandle>;
}

interface SubagentHandle {
  sessionId: string;      // the child Session id: the origin hop; subagent_id derives from its tail
  run(input: {
    messages: OmniMessage[];  // the round's input, the shape Session.run takes a Prompt in
    signal?: AbortSignal;
    approve?: ApproveFn;  // the parent's approval callback — forwarding is inheritance
  }): AsyncGenerator<OmniMessage>;
  dispose(): void;        // release the child Session's runtime resources; idempotent
}
```

Spawning and running are separate, so the same child Session can accept a follow-up Prompt after a turn ends (a long-running Subagent, driven via `input_subagent`). Child Sessions run in the same Workspace with their own Trace; nesting depth is currently capped at 1.

A round's input is an OmniMessage list — the same shape `steer` takes, and the same shape `EnvironmentInterface.sendToBackgroundSubagent` takes from a host — so both ways into a child session speak one vocabulary. The caller owns each message's `sender`: the model's own dispatch (`run_subagent`, `input_subagent`) stamps `parent_agent`, while a human's message from a host panel carries none, and the child's Trace records who actually spoke.

## VisionDescriberService

The image proxy-reading service for text-only models (needed by `read_file` when the Session model cannot view images — its presence is how the tool knows):

```ts
interface VisionDescriberService {
  modelId: string | null;          // null when the Project has no vision_model — the tool ends with a failed explanation
  createLLM?: () => LLMInterface;  // one-shot LLM for the vision model (no tools, no system prompt)
}
```

## Extension seams

| To … | Do … |
| --- | --- |
| Swap or customize model access | implement `LLMInterface` (or just set `client_type` for OpenAI-compatible endpoints) |
| Swap the execution sandbox | implement `EnvironmentInterface` |
| Add a tool | implement `BuiltinTool` + register a factory; or declare it under `tools.builtin` in `system_config.yaml` |
| Customize approval policy | inject an `ApproveFn` (the CLI/Web modes are wrappers over it) |
| Change an Agent's behavior | edit its Agent State: `system_config.yaml`, `AGENTS.md`, Skills — see the [Configuration Reference](/configuration) |
