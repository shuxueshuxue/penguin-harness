# Contributing to PenguinHarness

[中文版](CONTRIBUTING.zh.md)

Thanks for helping build PenguinHarness! This guide covers the workspace setup, daily
commands, quality gates, and the repo's working rules.

Participation is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). A security
problem does not go in a public issue — the [security policy](SECURITY.md) says where to
send it instead.

## Prerequisites

- Node >= 24
- pnpm 11 (`corepack enable` or `npm install -g pnpm`)

## Setup and daily commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build       # build first: core's exports point at dist/

pnpm dev         # backend + web app together (prefixed logs, deps built once)
pnpm dev:server  # backend at 127.0.0.1:7368 (not the installed server's 7364)
pnpm dev:web     # web app (Vite) at 127.0.0.1:7365, /api proxied to 7368
pnpm dev:docs    # docs site (Vite) at 127.0.0.1:7367
pnpm dev:landing # landing page (Vite) at 127.0.0.1:7366
pnpm penguin ... # CLI from source; `penguin web` serves at 127.0.0.1:7369
pnpm desktop     # desktop app from source (builds everything first, then Electron)

BASE_PATH=/ pnpm build:site   # assemble landing + docs exactly like the Pages deploy
```

Every dev command runs `scripts/dev-prebuild.mjs` first, which (behind a lock that
serializes concurrent invocations) **keeps `pnpm install` current automatically** — a
fresh clone or a pulled lockfile change installs before starting, and an up-to-date tree
pays nothing (the lockfile hash is stamped) — then prebuilds the workspace deps (skills,
core) with back-to-back builds deduped: starting `dev:server` and `dev:web` at the same
time (or just `pnpm dev`) installs and builds exactly once. When that build changes
skills/core output, the prestep also clears the web app's Vite dep cache
(`packages/web/node_modules/.vite`), which is keyed by lockfile/config only and would
otherwise keep serving the browser the previous core. `dev:docs` / `dev:landing`
run the install check only (`--install-only`).

One rule when bypassing the dev commands: **rebuild skills/core through pnpm, in that
order** (`pnpm build`, or restart `pnpm dev`) — the workspace uses injected dependencies
(`injectWorkspacePackages` in pnpm-workspace.yaml), so web/server consume snapshot copies
that only re-sync when the package's `build` script runs via pnpm
(`syncInjectedDepsAfterScripts`). A bare `npx tsup` in packages/core updates
`packages/core/dist` but leaves those snapshots — and any already-populated Vite dep
cache — on the old build; if a running dev web app still serves stale core after a manual
rebuild, delete `packages/web/node_modules/.vite` and restart.

Dev entry points that touch data default to separate data roots, kept apart from the
installed CLI/server's `~/.penguin/data` — hacking on the repo never mixes state with
your real agents. `pnpm dev`, `pnpm dev:server` and `pnpm desktop` share
`~/.penguin/dev-data`; `pnpm penguin` takes its own `~/.penguin/dev-data-cli`, because a
data root admits one server at a time (`<root>/server.lock`) and the dev CLI's
`penguin web` is exactly the harness that then asks an Agent to run `pnpm dev` — on a
shared root that Agent's `dev:server` would refuse to start, blocked by the harness's
own lock (the same coexistence that already gives it port 7369, see
`packages/core/src/internal/ports.ts`). To aim a dev CLI command at the `pnpm dev`
dataset anyway, say so per command — `PENGUIN_HOME=~/.penguin/dev-data pnpm penguin ...`,
or `--root` where the subcommand takes it. Need a different root?
Pass `PENGUIN_HOME` inline, for the single
command that needs it (`PENGUIN_HOME=~/.penguin/dev-data-<topic> pnpm dev`) — never export
it into your shell: those defaults apply only when the variable is unset or empty
(`scripts/run-with-env.mjs`), so an exported value silently wins over all of them, and an
exported `PENGUIN_HOME=~/.penguin/data` puts `pnpm dev:server` on the release/CLI root
where a running desktop app already holds the lock. The desktop dev shell isolates one
step further: an unpackaged run takes a dev-suffixed app identity (`PenguinHarness-Dev`)
with its own userData directory, single-instance lock, and sticky port, and defaults to
`~/.penguin/dev-data` even when launched without the env var
(`pnpm --dir packages/desktop start`) — so it runs side by side with an installed release
build, with neither instance seeing the other. Every dev-profile launch prints which pair
it picked: `[shell] dev instance '<name>' on data root <root>`.

That dev profile is a switch, not a property of being unpackaged: an installed release
build launched with `--dev` (a second shortcut whose target ends in `--dev`, or
`PenguinHarness.exe --dev`) takes the same dev identity and `~/.penguin/dev-data`, so one
installation runs twice side by side — the release instance on your real data and a
second one on a scratch root — without a checkout. It runs the release's own code, so it
is a way to try the app against separate data, not a way to see uncommitted changes. A
`--dev` instance does not update itself and does not repair the `penguin` command link;
both belong to the one installation the two instances share, and the release instance
does them. The profile also reaches other machines: the shell passes it to its server as
`PENGUIN_PROFILE`, and the Machines page then works with the machine's installation for
that profile — `~/.penguin-dev` on port 7370 for dev, beside the release one — so a dev
instance never touches the release server someone is using there
(`packages/server/src/machines/layout.ts`).

Two one-time moves came with that split. A bare `pnpm --dir packages/desktop start` used
to run on `~/.penguin/data` (the release/CLI root) and now runs on `~/.penguin/dev-data`,
so sessions made that way are no longer in the window — run it with
`PENGUIN_HOME=~/.penguin/data` to work against the release root on purpose. And the dev
shell's userData directory moved with its name, taking the Chromium profile along, so the
window's origin-scoped preferences (theme, language, layout) and its remembered port
start fresh once. Note the identity is one fixed name, not one per checkout: two working
copies both running the desktop shell still share it, and the second launch focuses the
first one's window instead of opening its own — a distinct `PENGUIN_HOME` does not change
that, because it moves the data root, not the identity.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for model credentials in development.

## Repo layout

A pnpm monorepo (TypeScript, Node >= 24). One install ships four layers that share a
single data directory (`~/.penguin/data`) and a single message protocol (OmniMessage):

| Package                                   | Name                          | Role                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`packages/core`](../packages/core)       | `@prismshadow/penguin-core`   | SDK & engine: ReAct loop, OmniMessage protocol, LLM/Environment interface contracts, Agent State, Trace |
| [`packages/cli`](../packages/cli)         | `@prismshadow/penguin-cli`    | The `penguin` command: REPL, one-shot runs, model & vault config, service launcher                      |
| [`packages/server`](../packages/server)   | `@prismshadow/penguin-server` | Web backend: HTTP API + SSE streaming, multi-user auth, Project authorization, usage stats              |
| [`packages/web`](../packages/web)         | `@prismshadow/penguin-web`    | Web App: multi-session chat, Agent/skill/model management, Trace observability, evaluation center       |
| [`plugins/*`](../plugins) | `@penguinharness/<name>` | The built-in plugins, one npm package each: skills (software development, model development, agent development/tuning, …) and session hooks (goal mode, skill summaries); the loader lives in `packages/core` |
| [`packages/landing`](../packages/landing) | —                             | Product landing page (this repo's website)                                                              |
| [`packages/docs`](../packages/docs)       | —                             | Documentation site (bilingual, deployed under `/docs/`)                                                 |
| [`plugins/*`](../plugins) | `@prismshadow/penguin-plugin-*` | Plugin packages a deployment installs and lists in `plugins.json` — a directory of their own because nothing else in the harness depends on one                        |

Responsibilities split by source of truth: the **SDK** owns protocol and execution
(message parsing, the agent loop, tools), the **Server** owns the multi-user runtime
(auth, SSE streaming, scheduled tasks), and the **file layer** under `~/.penguin/data`
owns everything editable and recorded (prompts, Skills, secrets, Traces). The full map
is in [Architecture → Division of responsibilities](https://penguin.ooo/docs/architecture).

## Quality gates

CI runs all of these on every PR — run them locally before pushing:

```bash
pnpm format:check   # prettier
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test           # unit suites for every package
```

Working on this repo with a coding agent: [`.agents/skills/penguin-harness-dev/`](../.agents/skills/penguin-harness-dev/SKILL.md)
collects the conventions that are easy to get wrong from the outside — the two-repo symlink
layout, the CI-parity chain, the record-and-ship contract, the model catalog's pricing rules,
and the seams that are intentional. `.claude` is a symlink to `.agents`, so a Claude Code
session and any other agent read the same directory.

End-to-end suites (optional locally, slower):

```bash
npx playwright install chromium                      # once
pnpm --filter @prismshadow/penguin-web test:e2e      # browser e2e against a mock LLM
pnpm test:e2e                                        # core live-model e2e, needs DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
```

## Working rules

- **English is the repository's working language** — code, comments, error/log messages,
  test names and fixtures, package metadata, and developer docs. Chinese appears only
  where it is the content itself: zh i18n catalogs and fields (`strings.ts` dictionaries,
  CLI `i18n.ts`, `titleZh`, `short_description_zh`), `*.zh.md` documents, and test
  literals that assert zh i18n output or exercise CJK-specific behavior.
- **Every change ships with a changelog entry, in both languages**: add
  `changelog/unreleased/YYYY-MM-DD-<semantic-id>.md` plus its `.zh.md` counterpart
  (released versions' folders are frozen) — an H1 title, the `Date` / `Type` / `Scope` /
  `PR` / `Issue` / `Breaking` metadata block, the counterpart link, then a lead paragraph
  and bespoke sections. There is no index file to update. The format is documented in
  [`changelog/README.md`](../changelog/README.md). Related changes may share one entry
  file (extending its sections) instead of opening a new file per small change.
- **A release ships its own announcement**: `changelog/<version>/RELEASE.md` is published
  verbatim as the GitHub Release body. Write it during release preparation and **commit it
  before creating the tag** — the release workflow reads it from the tag's checkout, so a
  file added later never reaches the Release page. Without it the workflow falls back to
  GitHub's auto-generated notes.
- **Release prep bumps the repo version**: the same `release: X.Y.Z` PR that renames
  `changelog/unreleased/` also bumps the root and every workspace `package.json`
  (`packages/*` and `plugins/*`)
  `version`, plus core's `VERSION` constant (`packages/core/src/index.ts`), to the release
  version. The release workflow refuses a tag push whose version does not match the
  repo's, so a forgotten bump fails before anything is published (v0.2.1 was tagged with a
  0.2.0 repo, and every dev build nagged about an update until the repo caught up).
- README assets under `assets/readme/` are generated — the benchmark charts from the
  landing benchmark data, and the demo screenshots via
  `node packages/landing/scripts/capture-readme-demo.mjs` (build first; needs Playwright
  chromium). Regenerate rather than hand-editing.

## Reporting a bug or proposing a feature

Open an issue from the [issue forms](https://github.com/Prism-Shadow/penguin-harness/issues/new/choose).
A bug report is worth far more with the version (`penguin version`), how PenguinHarness
was installed, the OS, and whether the problem survives a fresh data root
(`PENGUIN_HOME=/tmp/penguin-check penguin ...`) — that last one separates a code defect
from a state left behind by an earlier version. Never paste an API key, a bot token,
`system_config.yaml`, or a `.env` into an issue: the data root holds provider credentials
in plain text, and an issue is public and permanent.

Questions and usage help belong on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eFHKqqcU3D) or in the
WeChat group, not in the issue tracker.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main`; keep PRs focused on one topic.
- Make sure CI is green (build, format, typecheck, tests) and describe user-visible
  changes in the PR body.
- New user-facing behavior should come with tests, and with docs updates when it changes
  documented behavior (README, docs site).
- Write the title and body in English, and list what you actually ran under a
  `## Verification` heading. The [pull request template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) is
  filled in for you when you open the PR.
- Pull requests are squash-merged, so one PR lands on `main` as one commit. Merging needs
  one approving review and every review thread resolved.
