The models page's discount badge read `-50%`, a figure with no word beside it to say what was fifty percent less than what. It now reads `50% off` in English and `省 50%` in Chinese; the hover text saying whether the rate is a running promotion or an off-peak schedule is unchanged.

## Details

- `models.discountBadge` renders the new wording in both dictionaries; the `models` docs page describes the DeepSeek off-peak mark with it.
